Nutrition was consulted and concurred with dobhoff placement and provided tube feed recommendations. Solid diet with supplement is also recommended. Plastic surgery was consulted for your abdominal wounds and felt there was no concern for infection and that there more optimal nutrition status is required before unhealthy tissue can be removed. Plastics recommended follow up outpatient in ___ weeks. Podiatry surgery was also consulted for evaluation of bilateral dry, gangrenous digits but found no surrounding infection. Thus, there was no urgent surgical intervention indicated at this time. Given such, IV antibiotics was discontinued. Medicine was consulted for failure to thrive and sunset dementia, which was attributed to dry gangrene and being hospitalized. Outpatient follow up with oncology is recommended given her history of CML status post bone marrow transplant. Mirtazapine 30' QHS was started to stimulate appetite, with seemingly improved her appetite. Neuro: Toe pain was controlled with acetaminophen prn and home tramadol. Patient experienced delirium which was attributed to change in environment. Sleep hygiene and orientation was practiced with improved results. In addition to home Escitalopram, Mirtazapine 30' QHS was started to stimulate appetite, with seemingly improved her appetite. CV: home amlodipine, aspirin, atorvastatin were given. Vitals were monitored routinely and she was hemodynamically stable Resp: She is hemodynamically stable from respiratory standpoint with frequent OOB and IS use. GI: Dobhoff was placed on ___ with Nepro started per Nutrition's recommendation. On ___ during a delirius episode, dobhoff was self-removed. A new dobhoff was replaced and position was confirmed. Tube feed was switched to Jevity. She was on a diabetic diet with good PO intake. GU: Adult diaper was on for incontinence, and patient's ins and outs were recorded. ID: IV vancomycin, cipro, and flaygl were started empirically. Given dry gangrene and podiatry recommendation of no concerning osteomyelitis, IV antibiotics were stopped. White blood count has been stably elevated, known as chronic condition. Medicine recommended outpatient oncology follow up. Otherwise, she was afebrile during this admission. Endo: given tube feed and nutrients being restarted, insulin requirement was resumed as metformin was held. She is currently on Glargine 13Unit at dinner and regular sliding scale. At time of discharge, she was able to tolerate a regular diet and tube feed, get out of bed and ambulate with assistance and rollerwalker, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. She was deemed ready for discharge to rehab (expected rehab stay less than 30 days), and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions.\n",

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ year old female without significant PMHx who presented as a transfer from OSH with c/f seizures. Per the history she had an altercation with her boyfriend which involved her getting hit in the head with a trash can. Following this altercation she had shaking episodes and was taken by EMS to ___. She was treated for status with Ativan/midaz and loaded with keppra. Subsequently she was transferred to ___ and admitted to neurology for EEG monitoring. She had a captured event on EEG o/n ___ with shaking without electrographic correlate, consistent with a non-epileptic spell. She was taken off of EEG and had an additional spell of similar semiology. She had post-spell numbness of the left arm that began in her mid-deltoid and was circumferential, crossing multiple dermatomes without clear pattern. She also reported monocular double vision and had difficulty with finger counting even with central visual field testing, consistently naming \"2s\" as \"1\" and \"5\" as \"4s\". While we cannot rule out seizures occurring prior to admission, this seems less likely given reports of 5 extended episodes and normal EEG (hooked up within 12 hrs of episode). Social work evaluated the patient out of concern for home safety and provided the patient with multiple resources and other contact info. She was discharged home in stable condition without anti-seizure medication.

There was initial concern for seizures and you were given a seizure medication (keppra) which made you very tired. Because you were so tired, you were were transferred to ___ for further monitoring, in case you may have another event that was suspicion for a seizure. You were monitored overnight while on EEG. You had another shaking episode. This event was recorded on EEG and there was no abnormal activity detected, which means that your events that we saw are not seizures. The events that you have are called \"psychogenic non-epileptic spells.\" We did not start you on any seizure medications as these events are your body's response to stress. It is likely that your events are related to ongoing stressors in your life and we had our social workers see you to help set you up with resources at home. We attempted to set you up with a primary care provider, but you do not have insurance. We still scheduled you for an appointment listed below. If you are unable to make that appointment, you should still attempt to set up a primary care provider at your earliest convenience. You reportedly have insurance in ___.

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is pending at the time of discharge. ___ pathology department has requested the pathology specimens from the patient's past malignancy for comparison. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid per ID recommendation. The patient will complete a course of 2 additional weeks of linezolid after discharge. Rib fracture pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch. #Troponemia: Most likely secondary to demand. Appears to be .12 on last check at OSH.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control.

We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today. We treated him with ipratoprium/albuterol nebs and this should be discussed in the outpatient setting in terms of his COPD medications. . # Chronic Back Pain with Neuropathic Symptoms - continued gabapentin . # Restless Leg Syndrome - continued ropinirole at bedtime . # Depression - continued sertraline . # GERD - continued pantoprazole . #.

She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine. Her clonidine was discontinued and pressures remained within normal limits (120s-130s systolic). Her hypoxemia also spontaneously improved and may be related to a possible viral bronchitis. # OLIGURIA/HEMATURIA: Likely post-operative urinary retention after anesthesia. Straight cathed with output of 500cc dark wine colored urine. Bolused with 500cc. Low suspicion for neurogenic bladder given report of low back/CVA pain. Resolved midnight ___ pt denies dysuria, hematuria. Good rectal tone; neurogenic bladder unlikely. Resolved spontaneously. #ESRD ___ alport syndrome: She continued ___ HD while in-house. #Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Noted on ___ as well as our CTA. Likely reactive, however a CT chest as an outpatient should be considered to assess for resolution. #Thyroid nodule: Noted on CT chest, per PCP was previously scheduled for an outpatient thyroid ultrasound by her endocrinologist but did not show up for testing.

A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s.

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. .

He presented to ___ where a CT scan showed significant for large left hilar mass with apparent invasion of the pericardium with tumor extending into the left atrium. Staging MRI head significant for three enhancing lesions with slow diffusion and surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality, most likely representative of intracranial metastasis. Further staging with CT torso significant for multiple intraperitoneal, serosal, retroperitoneal, and intramuscular metastatic implants. EBUS was performed on ___ for tissue sample, which revealed small cell lung cancer with high proliferation index (___). He also had an FNA for a new right preauricular mass that showed malignancy as well. A TTE was performed which revealed mild-moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and LVEF >75%. Palliative care was consulted. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide (___), which he tolerated well with minimal GI complaints. He is scheduled for follow up with the Multi-Specialty Thoracic Clinic. He will be scheduled for port placement prior to the next round of chemotherapy. # Acute kidney injury: Patient presented with creatinine of 1.4. This improved to his baseline of 0.9 with fluid resuscitation, consistent with prerenal etiology. After initiating chemotherapy, he again developed ___ that was felt to be secondary to cisplatin. On discharge his creatinine was 1.0. # New oxygen requirement: Patient has a long smoking history and known severe COPD. He developed worsening dyspnea in the setting of impingement of the mass into the left sided bronchovasculature. He was managed with Advair, tiotropium, and Albuterol nebs as needed. He was discharged with home oxygen therapy. # Anemia: No known baseline. Iron studies were sent and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to his underlying malignancy. He did not require a blood transfusion during hospitalization. # Suspected BPH: Patient endorsed difficulty initiating a stream and reports previous history of prostate issues, but no longer on medication. He was started on tamsulosin 0.4mg PO QHS with improvement.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ yo man with history of paranoid schizophrenia and epilepsy who presents with breakthrough seizures felt likely to be due to medication non-compliance. #Breakthrough seizure: On presentation he was febrile with leukocytosis to 21. CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery.

Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications.

H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable through remainder of admission. He was discharged with plans to follow up with his PCP and with gastroenterology. After discharge h.pylori serology were +, patient will need to be treated by PCP as an outpatient. . # Chest pain: On evening after endoscopy, patient had an episode of substernal chest pain with associated ECG changes. Troponins were elevated but CKMB was WNL. His chest pain resolved with sublingual nitro x2. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and it was felt this chest pain was most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and anemia. He was subsequently transfused 2 units of PRBC. He remained chest pain free through the remainder of the admission and his troponins started to trend down by time of discharge. He was continued on his ASA, statin and plavix. He was also started on metoprolol. He has plans to follow up with cardiology as an outpatient. . # Chronic systolic CHF - Patient remained euvolemic throughout admission. His torsemide was initially held in the setting of GI bleed. However, it was subsequently restarted prior to discharge. He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission. . # Diabetes - Metformin was held during admission. His blood sugars were controlled with insulin sliding scale. . # Afib on coumadin - INR initially supratherapeutic (3.6) on presentation. He was treated with FFP initially and coumadin was held in the setting of GI bleed. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge. He has plans to have his INR rechecked on ___ at PCP follow up . # HTN - cont medications as above . # HLD - continued pravastatin . # PVD - Plavix and ASA initially held with GI bleed but restarted prior to discharge . Transitional Issues: - Just after discharge patients H. pylori antibody returned as positive. PCP and gastroenterologist were notified. Patient should be treated with Prevpac. - Patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg BID for PUD until GI follow up. - Patients INR was subtherapeutic upon discharge. His INR will need close follow up after discharge and coumadin dosing will likely need additional adjustment. - Patient was started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission given his hx of CAD and CHF. Patient will need his electrolytes checked within 2 weeks of discharge. He will also need his blood pressure and heart rate rechecked. - patient was.

She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. .

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo male with significant past cardiac history including CABG x2 and PCI x2 with chronic angina relieved by nitro transferred to cardiology service after right renal artery ___ embolization for a subcapsular hematoma resulting from MVA, for chest discomfort in the setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response from 2:1 atrial flutter refractory to metoprolol 15 mg and diltiazem 10 mg IV and ST depressions throughout precordial leads. . # MVA and subcapsular hematoma: After his MVA and subsequent imaging, Mr. ___ went urgently to ___ given extravasation from the lower pole of the kidney, which was embolized. A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##.

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is pending at the time of discharge. ___ pathology department has requested the pathology specimens from the patient's past malignancy for comparison. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid per ID recommendation. The patient will complete a course of 2 additional weeks of linezolid after discharge. Rib fracture pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch. #Troponemia: Most likely secondary to demand. Appears to be .12 on last check at OSH.

She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine. Her clonidine was discontinued and pressures remained within normal limits (120s-130s systolic). Her hypoxemia also spontaneously improved and may be related to a possible viral bronchitis. # OLIGURIA/HEMATURIA: Likely post-operative urinary retention after anesthesia.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s. Because of this, we started her back on a lower dose of metop at 12.5mg PO q6H, and transitioned her to metop 50mg XL daily at the time of discharge. We also discontinued her diltiazem.

In the ED he had stable vital signs but was found to have a Hgb/HCT of ___ (down from ___ in ___, however was previously anemic with HCTs between ___, and an elevated INR of 3.6. Patient was given 2 units of FFP and subsequently developed hives. He was then given benadryl and hives resolved. He was evaluated by GI with plans to do EGD/colonoscopy the following morning. His ASA, plavix, and coumadin were held. Patient was monitored overnight in the MICU. He was given IVF but no additional blood products. HCT remained stable around ___. He subsequently underwent an EGD/colonoscopy and was transferred to the medicine floor. Endoscopy was significant for duodenal ulcers, diverticulosis, and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He was transfused with 2 units of PRBC given demand ischemia (see below) and responded appropriately. ASA, plavix, and warfarin were restarted. H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable through remainder of admission. He was discharged with plans to follow up with his PCP and with gastroenterology.

Troponins were elevated but CKMB was WNL. His chest pain resolved with sublingual nitro x2. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and it was felt this chest pain was most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and anemia. He was subsequently transfused 2 units of PRBC. He remained chest pain free through the remainder of the admission and his troponins started to trend down by time of discharge. He was continued on his ASA, statin and plavix.

Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Pt was treated conservatively and physical therapy recommended acute rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and was treated with IV antibiotics for Hospital-acquired pneumonia. . #. Pubic Ramus fracture: Orthopedic surgery was consulted. OSH films revealed an acute R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. This was felt to be most likely due to her recent seizure. Medical management was recommended with outpatient orthopedics follow-up in ___ weeks. She was started on lovenox 40 mg qday for DVT prophylaxis to be continued for 4 weeks. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt the patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation. Tylenol ___ mg TID was started for pain. Calcium and VitD were started for bone health. . # Pneumonia: Patient had low-grade temperatures to 100.3 on ___ and 100.7 on ___. Out of concern for cough, a CXR was obtained, which showed a possible RML infiltrate vs. atelectasis. The following day, she became hypotensive to the ___, which responded to fluid bolus. Repeat CXR was obtained, which showed worsened pneumonia. She was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia initially with Cefepime 2g q24h, Vancomycin 750 mg q24h, and Metronidazole. Metronidazole was discontinued prior to discharge and she remained clinically stable off of this medication. The patient was discharged to complete a 7-day course of Cefepime and Vancomycin, last day ___. . # UTI: On admission, U/A and urine culture were negative. However, OSH records indicated she had been treated with 1-dose of ciprofloxacin for a sensitive enterococcus UTI. Repeat U/A was performed when the patient became hypotensive and culture grew enterococcus. Antibiotics with Vancomycin/Cefepime were continued as above, which provided appropriate coverage for UTI. The patient should not have a foley catheter placed under any circumstances given recurrent UTIs. . # Cough: Speech and swallow was consulted out of concern for the patient coughing during eating. They felt the patient showed no obvious signs of aspiration at bedside exam and recommended pureed foods, thin liquids, and 1:1 assistance with eating. If there is coughing with eating, the patient may benefit from a video swallow study. . #. Seizure d/o: Pts first seizure was ___ years ago and was started on Keppra 500 mg BID which was decreased to once daily with symptoms of somnolence. She was recently weaned off Keppra and developed recurrent seizures for which she was seen at an OSH in ___. Keppra was restarted at her prior dose of 500 mg per day. This low dose was discussed with ___ at ___ and was felt to be reasonable given her age, size, and prior success with this dose. She was kept on seizure precautions. . # CVA: Pt with h/o CVA. Carotid duplex was obtained, which showed 40-59% stenosis bilaterally. ASA 325 mg per day was continued for secondary prophylaxis as the patient had a history of hemoptysis on plavix therapy. . #.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 qdaily for improved BP control. #CAD: Patient's last cath was in ___ which was negative. ___ cath showed moderate single vessel disease and was advised to be medically managed. His home aspirin, statin, and metprolol were continued while he was hospitalized. #HX OF STROKE: Patient has suffered stroke in the past and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. His home plavix and aspirin were continued. #HYPERTENSION: Hypertensive to 180s systolic on admission. Goal BP for this elderly gentleman is 160s systolic, will attempt to control BP in light of flash pulmonary edema on admission. His home hydralazine and metoprolol were continued, and his metporolol dose was increased to provide better control of his blood pressures at home. #DM - Stable, patient's home lantus regimen was continued with additional insulin sl.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s. Because of this, we started her back on a lower dose of metop at 12.5mg PO q6H, and transitioned her to metop 50mg XL daily at the time of discharge. We also discontinued her diltiazem. At the time of discharge, her sinus bradycardia had resolved and she was asymptomatic. She will follow-up with cardiology on ___. #Hypertension: During this admission, Ms. ___ became hypertensive with blood pressure ranging from 120s-160s/60s-80s. We started her on amlodipine 10mg and her blood pressure continuously improved. At the time of discharge, her blood pressures were from 120s-140s/60s-80s. ___: At the time of admission, Ms. ___ had a ___ of 1.4 that was likely ___ decreased renal forward flow combined with decreased PO intake. We managed her bradycardia as above and encouraged her to increase her intake of POs. Her ___ normalized and Cr was back to 0.9 at the time of discharge. #Primary Prevention: Due to her history of diabetes, hypertension and CAD, we started her on aspirin 81mg daily. We continued her on her home pravastatin. #Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia from macroglobulinemia and cold agglutinins but has a new drop in MCV from 88 to 78.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##. SBP. 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid was drained on ___ and met criteria for SBP. 150gms of albumin was administered ___ and another 150gms of albumin were administered on ___ per protocol. She was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q24 on ___ and completed a ___ipro prophylaxis was considered, although it was felt that prohpylaxis was probably unnecessary because the fluid was likely only positive for SBP due to her underlying malignancy. . ##.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not. We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today. We treated him with ipratoprium/albuterol nebs and this should be discussed in the outpatient setting in terms of his COPD medications. . # Chronic Back Pain with Neuropathic Symptoms - continued gabapentin . # Restless Leg Syndrome - continued ropinirole at bedtime . # Depression - continued sertraline . # GERD - continued pantoprazole . #.

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion.

Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo male with significant past cardiac history including CABG x2 and PCI x2 with chronic angina relieved by nitro transferred to cardiology service after right renal artery ___ embolization for a subcapsular hematoma resulting from MVA, for chest discomfort in the setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response from 2:1 atrial flutter refractory to metoprolol 15 mg and diltiazem 10 mg IV and ST depressions throughout precordial leads. . # MVA and subcapsular hematoma: After his MVA and subsequent imaging, Mr. ___ went urgently to ___ given extravasation from the lower pole of the kidney, which was embolized. A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA.

She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine. Her clonidine was discontinued and pressures remained within normal limits (120s-130s systolic). Her hypoxemia also spontaneously improved and may be related to a possible viral bronchitis. # OLIGURIA/HEMATURIA: Likely post-operative urinary retention after anesthesia. Straight cathed with output of 500cc dark wine colored urine. Bolused with 500cc. Low suspicion for neurogenic bladder given report of low back/CVA pain. Resolved midnight ___ pt denies dysuria, hematuria. Good rectal tone; neurogenic bladder unlikely. Resolved spontaneously. #ESRD ___ alport syndrome: She continued ___ HD while in-house. #Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Noted on ___ as well as our CTA. Likely reactive, however a CT chest as an outpatient should be considered to assess for resolution. #Thyroid nodule: Noted on CT chest, per PCP was previously scheduled for an outpatient thyroid ultrasound by her endocrinologist but did not show up for testing. She should have an U/S as an outpatient. #Anemia: Has chronic anemia ___ renal disease, held stable. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Will need INR checked on ___ with adjustment in warfarin dose to maintain INR of ___. [ ] consider hematology consultation as an outpatient to discuss the duration of her anticoagulation course given that she may have had a prior clot at her HD line site and will likely need a continued HD line. [ ] her clonidine was discontinued given that she had an episode of hypotension and pressures were stable in 120s-130s without clonidine. Consider restarting if clinically indicated.

He presented to ___ where a CT scan showed significant for large left hilar mass with apparent invasion of the pericardium with tumor extending into the left atrium. Staging MRI head significant for three enhancing lesions with slow diffusion and surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality, most likely representative of intracranial metastasis. Further staging with CT torso significant for multiple intraperitoneal, serosal, retroperitoneal, and intramuscular metastatic implants. EBUS was performed on ___ for tissue sample, which revealed small cell lung cancer with high proliferation index (___). He also had an FNA for a new right preauricular mass that showed malignancy as well. A TTE was performed which revealed mild-moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and LVEF >75%. Palliative care was consulted. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide (___), which he tolerated well with minimal GI complaints. He is scheduled for follow up with the Multi-Specialty Thoracic Clinic. He will be scheduled for port placement prior to the next round of chemotherapy. # Acute kidney injury: Patient presented with creatinine of 1.4. This improved to his baseline of 0.9 with fluid resuscitation, consistent with prerenal etiology. After initiating chemotherapy, he again developed ___ that was felt to be secondary to cisplatin. On discharge his creatinine was 1.0. # New oxygen requirement: Patient has a long smoking history and known severe COPD. He developed worsening dyspnea in the setting of impingement of the mass into the left sided bronchovasculature. He was managed with Advair, tiotropium, and Albuterol nebs as needed. He was discharged with home oxygen therapy. # Anemia: No known baseline. Iron studies were sent and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to his underlying malignancy.

Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 qdaily for improved BP control. #CAD: Patient's last cath was in ___ which was negative. ___ cath showed moderate single vessel disease and was advised to be medically managed. His home aspirin, statin, and metprolol were continued while he was hospitalized. #HX OF STROKE: Patient has suffered stroke in the past and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. His home plavix and aspirin were continued. #HYPERTENSION: Hypertensive to 180s systolic on admission. Goal BP for this elderly gentleman is 160s systolic, will attempt to control BP in light of flash pulmonary edema on admission. His home hydralazine and metoprolol were continued, and his metporolol dose was increased to provide better control of his blood pressures at home. #DM - Stable, patient's home lantus regimen was continued with additional insulin sl.

Exam improved quickly with diuresis, though course was complicated by urosepsis, as below. Ultimately diuresed well on Lasix drip at 15 units per hour. Home beta blocker was discontinued in the setting of bradycardia, and spironolactone stopped given hyperkalemia. On day of discharge, patient was net negative 3L for the admission, and her symptoms had improved significantly. Torsemide was increased to 30mg daily. Discharge weight: 64.5 kg # Sepsis secondary to urinary source: Patient presented with increased urinary frequency and subjective fevers at home. Was found to have leukocytosis to 14, grossly positive urinalysis, and systolic blood pressure in the ___. Hemodynamics improved after IVF. Blood cultures showed no growth. Treated with cefepime/ceftriaxone for total course of ten days. Of note, attempted to switch to oral ciprofloxacin, but patient developed a drug rash (as below), put back on ceftriaxone for the duration of the antibiotic course. # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Known history of chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 1.6-1.8. Elevated to 2.6 on admission. Thought to be cardiorenal in setting of acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation vs. acute tubular necrosis related to hypotension in the setting of urosepsis. Over the course of her stay, function remained stable between ___, and ultimately returned to baseline of 1.8 with diuresis. # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 113 on admission, down from recent baseline. Likely marrow suppression in setting of sepsis as above. Of note, remained 90-115 throughout admission. # Drug rash: Patient was administered ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection, subsequently developed pruritic morbilliform rash and eosinophilia consistent with drug rash. Her rash improved with stopping the ciprofloxacin. =========================== CHRONIC ISSUES: =========================== # Coronary artery disease: Continued aspirin, stopped metoprolol # Hypertension: Discontinued Imdur, spironolactone, and metoprolol # Type II diabetes: Reduced insulin dose due to low morning blood sguars # Gastroesophageal reflux: Continued protonix =========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =========================== - Discharge weight: 64.5 kg - Discharge creatinine: 1.8 - Changed medications: Increased torsemide to 30mg daily; metolazone 5 mg PRN as directed by her cardiologist - Lantus decreased to 2 units nightly given low morning blood sugars; continue to monitor blood sugar and titrate regimen as appropriate - Discontinued medications: Metoprolol, spironolactone, Imdur - Recommend checking renal function, electrolytes.

Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery. Patient's left ankle was splinted and casted on second day of hospitalization and she is to follow-up in Orthopedic Surgery Clinic on ___ at 11:00 am. Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications. Her affect was initially depressed and she was frequently tearful when discussing her psychosocial stressors, roommate's delirium etc. Patient is followed closely by psychiatrist ___ as outpatient. . #.

CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___.

Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA.

Patient was given 2 units of FFP and subsequently developed hives. He was then given benadryl and hives resolved. He was evaluated by GI with plans to do EGD/colonoscopy the following morning. His ASA, plavix, and coumadin were held. Patient was monitored overnight in the MICU. He was given IVF but no additional blood products. HCT remained stable around ___. He subsequently underwent an EGD/colonoscopy and was transferred to the medicine floor. Endoscopy was significant for duodenal ulcers, diverticulosis, and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He was transfused with 2 units of PRBC given demand ischemia (see below) and responded appropriately. ASA, plavix, and warfarin were restarted. H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable through remainder of admission.

            "Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF DISCHARGE SUMMARY ========================= Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with Sjogren's syndrome and Lupus c/b Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ with allograft CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) and history of DVT who presented with fever. She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Pt was treated conservatively and physical therapy recommended acute rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and was treated with IV antibiotics for Hospital-acquired pneumonia. . #. Pubic Ramus fracture: Orthopedic surgery was consulted. OSH films revealed an acute R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. This was felt to be most likely due to her recent seizure. Medical management was recommended with outpatient orthopedics follow-up in ___ weeks. She was started on lovenox 40 mg qday for DVT prophylaxis to be continued for 4 weeks. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt the patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation. Tylenol ___ mg TID was started for pain. Calcium and VitD were started for bone health. . # Pneumonia: Patient had low-grade temperatures to 100.3 on ___ and 100.7 on ___. Out of concern for cough, a CXR was obtained, which showed a possible RML infiltrate vs. atelectasis. The following day, she became hypotensive to the ___, which responded to fluid bolus. Repeat CXR was obtained, which showed worsened pneumonia. She was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia initially with Cefepime 2g q24h, Vancomycin 750 mg q24h, and Metronidazole. Metronidazole was discontinued prior to discharge and she remained clinically stable off of this medication. The patient was discharged to complete a 7-day course of Cefepime and Vancomycin, last day ___. . # UTI: On admission, U/A and urine culture were negative. However, OSH records indicated she had been treated with 1-dose of ciprofloxacin for a sensitive enterococcus UTI. Repeat U/A was performed when the patient became hypotensive and culture grew enterococcus. Antibiotics with Vancomycin/Cefepime were continued as above, which provided appropriate coverage for UTI. The patient should not have a foley catheter placed under any circumstances given recurrent UTIs. . # Cough: Speech and swallow was consulted out of concern for the patient coughing during eating. They felt the patient showed no obvious signs of aspiration at bedside exam and recommended pureed foods, thin liquids, and 1:1 assistance with eating. If there is coughing with eating, the patient may benefit from a video swallow study. . #. Seizure d/o: Pts first seizure was ___ years ago and was started on Keppra 500 mg BID which was decreased to once daily with symptoms of somnolence. She was recently weaned off Keppra and developed recurrent seizures for which she was seen at an OSH in ___. Keppra was restarted at her prior dose of 500 mg per day. This low dose was discussed with ___ at ___ and was felt to be reasonable given her age, size, and prior success with this dose. She was kept on seizure precautions. . # CVA: Pt with h/o CVA. Carotid duplex was obtained, which showed 40-59% stenosis bilaterally. ASA 325 mg per day was continued for secondary prophylaxis as the patient had a history of hemoptysis on plavix therapy. . #.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo male with significant past cardiac history including CABG x2 and PCI x2 with chronic angina relieved by nitro transferred to cardiology service after right renal artery ___ embolization for a subcapsular hematoma resulting from MVA, for chest discomfort in the setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response from 2:1 atrial flutter refractory to metoprolol 15 mg and diltiazem 10 mg IV and ST depressions throughout precordial leads. . # MVA and subcapsular hematoma: After his MVA and subsequent imaging, Mr. ___ went urgently to ___ given extravasation from the lower pole of the kidney, which was embolized. A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA. This resolved over the next few days. . #CODE: Full #CONTACT:. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_length`.\n",

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. . TRANSITION OF CARE: [ ] Rheumatology - Determine whether or not to continue Prednisone at the ___ clinic visit. [ ] Neurology - Followup the patient's symptoms from her cervical spondylosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is pending at the time of discharge. ___ pathology department has requested the pathology specimens from the patient's past malignancy for comparison. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid per ID recommendation. The patient will complete a course of 2 additional weeks of linezolid after discharge. Rib fracture pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch. #Troponemia: Most likely secondary to demand. Appears to be .12 on last check at OSH.

He presented to ___ where a CT scan showed significant for large left hilar mass with apparent invasion of the pericardium with tumor extending into the left atrium. Staging MRI head significant for three enhancing lesions with slow diffusion and surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality, most likely representative of intracranial metastasis. Further staging with CT torso significant for multiple intraperitoneal, serosal, retroperitoneal, and intramuscular metastatic implants. EBUS was performed on ___ for tissue sample, which revealed small cell lung cancer with high proliferation index (___). He also had an FNA for a new right preauricular mass that showed malignancy as well. A TTE was performed which revealed mild-moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and LVEF >75%. Palliative care was consulted. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide (___), which he tolerated well with minimal GI complaints. He is scheduled for follow up with the Multi-Specialty Thoracic Clinic. He will be scheduled for port placement prior to the next round of chemotherapy. # Acute kidney injury: Patient presented with creatinine of 1.4. This improved to his baseline of 0.9 with fluid resuscitation, consistent with prerenal etiology. After initiating chemotherapy, he again developed ___ that was felt to be secondary to cisplatin. On discharge his creatinine was 1.0. # New oxygen requirement: Patient has a long smoking history and known severe COPD. He developed worsening dyspnea in the setting of impingement of the mass into the left sided bronchovasculature. He was managed with Advair, tiotropium, and Albuterol nebs as needed. He was discharged with home oxygen therapy. # Anemia: No known baseline. Iron studies were sent and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to his underlying malignancy. He did not require a blood transfusion during hospitalization. # Suspected BPH: Patient endorsed difficulty initiating a stream and reports previous history of prostate issues, but no longer on medication.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##. SBP. 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid was drained on ___ and met criteria for SBP. 150gms of albumin was administered ___ and another 150gms of albumin were administered on ___ per protocol. She was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q24 on ___ and completed a ___ipro prophylaxis was considered, although it was felt that prohpylaxis was probably unnecessary because the fluid was likely only positive for SBP due to her underlying malignancy. . ##.

ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine.

            "Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ w/ HTN, two months of dry cough, who presented with fever to 103.6F, rigors, and encephalopathy; found to have strep pneumoniae endocarditis of aortic and tricuspid valves. Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

Exam improved quickly with diuresis, though course was complicated by urosepsis, as below. Ultimately diuresed well on Lasix drip at 15 units per hour. Home beta blocker was discontinued in the setting of bradycardia, and spironolactone stopped given hyperkalemia. On day of discharge, patient was net negative 3L for the admission, and her symptoms had improved significantly. Torsemide was increased to 30mg daily. Discharge weight: 64.5 kg # Sepsis secondary to urinary source: Patient presented with increased urinary frequency and subjective fevers at home. Was found to have leukocytosis to 14, grossly positive urinalysis, and systolic blood pressure in the ___. Hemodynamics improved after IVF. Blood cultures showed no growth. Treated with cefepime/ceftriaxone for total course of ten days. Of note, attempted to switch to oral ciprofloxacin, but patient developed a drug rash (as below), put back on ceftriaxone for the duration of the antibiotic course. # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Known history of chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 1.6-1.8. Elevated to 2.6 on admission. Thought to be cardiorenal in setting of acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation vs. acute tubular necrosis related to hypotension in the setting of urosepsis. Over the course of her stay, function remained stable between ___, and ultimately returned to baseline of 1.8 with diuresis. # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 113 on admission, down from recent baseline. Likely marrow suppression in setting of sepsis as above. Of note, remained 90-115 throughout admission. # Drug rash: Patient was administered ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection, subsequently developed pruritic morbilliform rash and eosinophilia consistent with drug rash. Her rash improved with stopping the ciprofloxacin. =========================== CHRONIC ISSUES: =========================== # Coronary artery disease: Continued aspirin, stopped metoprolol # Hypertension: Discontinued Imdur, spironolactone, and metoprolol # Type II diabetes: Reduced insulin dose due to low morning blood sguars # Gastroesophageal reflux: Continued protonix =========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =========================== - Discharge weight: 64.5 kg - Discharge creatinine: 1.8 - Changed medications: Increased torsemide to 30mg daily; metolazone 5 mg PRN as directed by her cardiologist - Lantus decreased to 2 units nightly given low morning blood sugars; continue to monitor blood sugar and titrate regimen as appropriate - Discontinued medications: Metoprolol, spironolactone, Imdur - Recommend checking renal function, electrolytes.

Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery. Patient's left ankle was splinted and casted on second day of hospitalization and she is to follow-up in Orthopedic Surgery Clinic on ___ at 11:00 am. Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications. Her affect was initially depressed and she was frequently tearful when discussing her psychosocial stressors, roommate's delirium etc. Patient is followed closely by psychiatrist ___ as outpatient. . #. Hypertension: Patient was continued on home metoprolol with SBPs 100-120s . #.

She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF.

Also noted to have hypernatremia, likely secondary to dehydration/decreased PO intake. . #Altered Mental Status: The patient initially presented to the ED after he was found to be more lethargic by his family. His mental status changes were felt to be secondary to infectious etiology, given fever, leukocytosis, and imaging findings of possible pneumonia and colitis on presentation. His mental status improved with antibiotics and IVFs, and he was back to his baseline mental status prior to discharge. Of note, he is generally non-verbal at baseline, with occasional mumbled speech. Per his family, he will respond to hearing his name, but does not follow commands. . #Colitis: Patient presented with diffuse abdominal tenderness on exam, and CT abdomen/pelvis findings were suggestive of colitis (infectious vs. inflammatory vs. ischemic) in the descending colon. Stool was guiac positive. Lactate was within normal limits. Given fever and leukocytosis in addition to exam and imaging findings, the patient was started on antibiotic therapy. He had received vanco/zosyn and metronidazole initially in ED, and was switched to metronidazole/levofloxacin on transfer to floor given concern for colitis and CAP. Following initiation of antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile, WBC trended down, and abdominal tenderness resolved.

CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

Patient appeared clinically well with normal vital signs; lactate uptrended and did not improve with IVF. Suspected type B lactic acidosis secondary to malignancy. For acidosis she was given NaHCO3 supplementation both PO and IV which improved her bicarb to 15 upon discharge. Her lactate also trended down as her renal function improved. She was discharged on PO sodium bicarb replacement with close oncologic follow up. # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 3.6 on admission and continued uptrending to a max of 5.8. Thought most likely secondary to ATN from poor PO intake recently. Renal were consulted and also had concern for HRS like physiology given liver metastases and evidence of poor hepatic function. However, ___ improved without intervention and patient's urine output was >1L daily with evidence of post-ATN diuresis. Her Cr was trending down upon discharge and she had no immediate need for HD as her potassium and phosphorus were normal. She was discharged with close follow up. # Hypernatremia: To peak 152, thought likely due to poor PO intake and sodium bicarb repletion. PO was encouraged and free water repleted. Sodium normal (144) upon discharge. # Nausea and Vomiting: Suspected due to recent chemotherapy, possible contribution of liver metastases and hepatomegaly. Given ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and lorazepam prn with good effect. # Hyperuricemia: Concerning for tumor lysis syndrome. Hem/onc were consulted and had low concern. She did receive rasburicase in ED x1, with resolution. # Transaminitis: Albumin and INR relatively normal. Thought likely secondary to massive hepatic infiltration with tumor.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s. Because of this, we started her back on a lower dose of metop at 12.5mg PO q6H, and transitioned her to metop 50mg XL daily at the time of discharge. We also discontinued her diltiazem.

We managed her bradycardia as above and encouraged her to increase her intake of POs. Her ___ normalized and Cr was back to 0.9 at the time of discharge. #Primary Prevention: Due to her history of diabetes, hypertension and CAD, we started her on aspirin 81mg daily. We continued her on her home pravastatin. #Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia from macroglobulinemia and cold agglutinins but has a new drop in MCV from 88 to 78.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not. We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo male with significant past cardiac history including CABG x2 and PCI x2 with chronic angina relieved by nitro transferred to cardiology service after right renal artery ___ embolization for a subcapsular hematoma resulting from MVA, for chest discomfort in the setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response from 2:1 atrial flutter refractory to metoprolol 15 mg and diltiazem 10 mg IV and ST depressions throughout precordial leads. . # MVA and subcapsular hematoma: After his MVA and subsequent imaging, Mr. ___ went urgently to ___ given extravasation from the lower pole of the kidney, which was embolized. A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA.

            "Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMH of Alport syndrome c/b ESRD on ___ HD, bipolar disorder, and PTSD who presented with ___nd facial swelling, cough, and orthopnea and was found to have SVC syndrome. #SVC syndrome: #Deep vein thrombosis: On ___, she developed acute-onset neck and facial swelling and presented to ___ Ed. She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine. Her clonidine was discontinued and pressures remained within normal limits (120s-130s systolic). Her hypoxemia also spontaneously improved and may be related to a possible viral bronchitis. # OLIGURIA/HEMATURIA: Likely post-operative urinary retention after anesthesia. Straight cathed with output of 500cc dark wine colored urine. Bolused with 500cc. Low suspicion for neurogenic bladder given report of low back/CVA pain. Resolved midnight ___ pt denies dysuria, hematuria. Good rectal tone; neurogenic bladder unlikely. Resolved spontaneously. #ESRD ___ alport syndrome: She continued ___ HD while in-house. #Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Noted on ___ as well as our CTA. Likely reactive, however a CT chest as an outpatient should be considered to assess for resolution. #Thyroid nodule: Noted on CT chest, per PCP was previously scheduled for an outpatient thyroid ultrasound by her endocrinologist but did not show up for testing. She should have an U/S as an outpatient. #Anemia: Has chronic anemia ___ renal disease, held stable. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Will need INR checked on ___ with adjustment in warfarin dose to maintain INR of ___. [ ] consider hematology consultation as an outpatient to discuss the duration of her anticoagulation course given that she may have had a prior clot at her HD line site and will likely need a continued HD line. [ ] her clonidine was discontinued given that she had an episode of hypotension and pressures were stable in 120s-130s without clonidine. Consider restarting if clinically indicated.

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. . TRANSITION OF CARE: [ ] Rheumatology - Determine whether or not to continue Prednisone at the ___ clinic visit. [ ] Neurology - Followup the patient's symptoms from her cervical spondylosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo female with PMH of anxiety/depression who present with tremors and falls without LOC. . #. Falls/tremors: Etiology remains unclear. Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery. Patient's left ankle was splinted and casted on second day of hospitalization and she is to follow-up in Orthopedic Surgery Clinic on ___ at 11:00 am. Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications. Her affect was initially depressed and she was frequently tearful when discussing her psychosocial stressors, roommate's delirium etc. Patient is followed closely by psychiatrist ___ as outpatient. . #. Hypertension: Patient was continued on home metoprolol with SBPs 100-120s . #.

Pt was treated conservatively and physical therapy recommended acute rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and was treated with IV antibiotics for Hospital-acquired pneumonia. . #. Pubic Ramus fracture: Orthopedic surgery was consulted. OSH films revealed an acute R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. This was felt to be most likely due to her recent seizure. Medical management was recommended with outpatient orthopedics follow-up in ___ weeks. She was started on lovenox 40 mg qday for DVT prophylaxis to be continued for 4 weeks. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt the patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation. Tylenol ___ mg TID was started for pain. Calcium and VitD were started for bone health. . # Pneumonia: Patient had low-grade temperatures to 100.3 on ___ and 100.7 on ___. Out of concern for cough, a CXR was obtained, which showed a possible RML infiltrate vs. atelectasis. The following day, she became hypotensive to the ___, which responded to fluid bolus. Repeat CXR was obtained, which showed worsened pneumonia. She was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia initially with Cefepime 2g q24h, Vancomycin 750 mg q24h, and Metronidazole. Metronidazole was discontinued prior to discharge and she remained clinically stable off of this medication. The patient was discharged to complete a 7-day course of Cefepime and Vancomycin, last day ___. . # UTI: On admission, U/A and urine culture were negative. However, OSH records indicated she had been treated with 1-dose of ciprofloxacin for a sensitive enterococcus UTI. Repeat U/A was performed when the patient became hypotensive and culture grew enterococcus. Antibiotics with Vancomycin/Cefepime were continued as above, which provided appropriate coverage for UTI. The patient should not have a foley catheter placed under any circumstances given recurrent UTIs. . # Cough: Speech and swallow was consulted out of concern for the patient coughing during eating. They felt the patient showed no obvious signs of aspiration at bedside exam and recommended pureed foods, thin liquids, and 1:1 assistance with eating. If there is coughing with eating, the patient may benefit from a video swallow study. . #. Seizure d/o: Pts first seizure was ___ years ago and was started on Keppra 500 mg BID which was decreased to once daily with symptoms of somnolence. She was recently weaned off Keppra and developed recurrent seizures for which she was seen at an OSH in ___. Keppra was restarted at her prior dose of 500 mg per day. This low dose was discussed with ___ at ___ and was felt to be reasonable given her age, size, and prior success with this dose. She was kept on seizure precautions. . # CVA: Pt with h/o CVA. Carotid duplex was obtained, which showed 40-59% stenosis bilaterally. ASA 325 mg per day was continued for secondary prophylaxis as the patient had a history of hemoptysis on plavix therapy. . #.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ yo man with history of paranoid schizophrenia and epilepsy who presents with breakthrough seizures felt likely to be due to medication non-compliance. #Breakthrough seizure: On presentation he was febrile with leukocytosis to 21. CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

Patient appeared clinically well with normal vital signs; lactate uptrended and did not improve with IVF. Suspected type B lactic acidosis secondary to malignancy. For acidosis she was given NaHCO3 supplementation both PO and IV which improved her bicarb to 15 upon discharge. Her lactate also trended down as her renal function improved. She was discharged on PO sodium bicarb replacement with close oncologic follow up. # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 3.6 on admission and continued uptrending to a max of 5.8. Thought most likely secondary to ATN from poor PO intake recently. Renal were consulted and also had concern for HRS like physiology given liver metastases and evidence of poor hepatic function. However, ___ improved without intervention and patient's urine output was >1L daily with evidence of post-ATN diuresis. Her Cr was trending down upon discharge and she had no immediate need for HD as her potassium and phosphorus were normal. She was discharged with close follow up. # Hypernatremia: To peak 152, thought likely due to poor PO intake and sodium bicarb repletion. PO was encouraged and free water repleted.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted.

Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission.

She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s. Because of this, we started her back on a lower dose of metop at 12.5mg PO q6H, and transitioned her to metop 50mg XL daily at the time of discharge. We also discontinued her diltiazem. At the time of discharge, her sinus bradycardia had resolved and she was asymptomatic. She will follow-up with cardiology on ___. #Hypertension: During this admission, Ms. ___ became hypertensive with blood pressure ranging from 120s-160s/60s-80s. We started her on amlodipine 10mg and her blood pressure continuously improved. At the time of discharge, her blood pressures were from 120s-140s/60s-80s. ___: At the time of admission, Ms. ___ had a ___ of 1.4 that was likely ___ decreased renal forward flow combined with decreased PO intake. We managed her bradycardia as above and encouraged her to increase her intake of POs. Her ___ normalized and Cr was back to 0.9 at the time of discharge. #Primary Prevention: Due to her history of diabetes, hypertension and CAD, we started her on aspirin 81mg daily. We continued her on her home pravastatin. #Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia from macroglobulinemia and cold agglutinins but has a new drop in MCV from 88 to 78.

A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA.

She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention.

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. . TRANSITION OF CARE: [ ] Rheumatology - Determine whether or not to continue Prednisone at the ___ clinic visit. [ ] Neurology - Followup the patient's symptoms from her cervical spondylosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

            "Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF DISCHARGE SUMMARY ========================= Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with Sjogren's syndrome and Lupus c/b Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ with allograft CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) and history of DVT who presented with fever. She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo female with PMH of anxiety/depression who present with tremors and falls without LOC. . #. Falls/tremors: Etiology remains unclear. Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery. Patient's left ankle was splinted and casted on second day of hospitalization and she is to follow-up in Orthopedic Surgery Clinic on ___ at 11:00 am. Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications. Her affect was initially depressed and she was frequently tearful when discussing her psychosocial stressors, roommate's delirium etc. Patient is followed closely by psychiatrist ___ as outpatient. . #.

Patient was given 2 units of FFP and subsequently developed hives. He was then given benadryl and hives resolved. He was evaluated by GI with plans to do EGD/colonoscopy the following morning. His ASA, plavix, and coumadin were held. Patient was monitored overnight in the MICU. He was given IVF but no additional blood products. HCT remained stable around ___. He subsequently underwent an EGD/colonoscopy and was transferred to the medicine floor. Endoscopy was significant for duodenal ulcers, diverticulosis, and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He was transfused with 2 units of PRBC given demand ischemia (see below) and responded appropriately. ASA, plavix, and warfarin were restarted. H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable through remainder of admission. He was discharged with plans to follow up with his PCP and with gastroenterology. After discharge h.pylori serology were +, patient will need to be treated by PCP as an outpatient. . # Chest pain: On evening after endoscopy, patient had an episode of substernal chest pain with associated ECG changes. Troponins were elevated but CKMB was WNL. His chest pain resolved with sublingual nitro x2. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and it was felt this chest pain was most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and anemia. He was subsequently transfused 2 units of PRBC. He remained chest pain free through the remainder of the admission and his troponins started to trend down by time of discharge. He was continued on his ASA, statin and plavix. He was also started on metoprolol. He has plans to follow up with cardiology as an outpatient. . # Chronic systolic CHF - Patient remained euvolemic throughout admission. His torsemide was initially held in the setting of GI bleed. However, it was subsequently restarted prior to discharge. He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission. . # Diabetes - Metformin was held during admission. His blood sugars were controlled with insulin sliding scale. . # Afib on coumadin - INR initially supratherapeutic (3.6) on presentation. He was treated with FFP initially and coumadin was held in the setting of GI bleed. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge. He has plans to have his INR rechecked on ___ at PCP follow up . # HTN - cont medications as above . # HLD - continued pravastatin . # PVD - Plavix and ASA initially held with GI bleed but restarted prior to discharge . Transitional Issues: - Just after discharge patients H. pylori antibody returned as positive. PCP and gastroenterologist were notified. Patient should be treated with Prevpac. - Patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg BID for PUD until GI follow up. - Patients INR was subtherapeutic upon discharge. His INR will need close follow up after discharge and coumadin dosing will likely need additional adjustment. - Patient was started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission given his hx of CAD and CHF.

            "Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ w/ HTN, two months of dry cough, who presented with fever to 103.6F, rigors, and encephalopathy; found to have strep pneumoniae endocarditis of aortic and tricuspid valves. Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 qdaily for improved BP control. #CAD: Patient's last cath was in ___ which was negative. ___ cath showed moderate single vessel disease and was advised to be medically managed. His home aspirin, statin, and metprolol were continued while he was hospitalized. #HX OF STROKE: Patient has suffered stroke in the past and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. His home plavix and aspirin were continued. #HYPERTENSION: Hypertensive to 180s systolic on admission. Goal BP for this elderly gentleman is 160s systolic, will attempt to control BP in light of flash pulmonary edema on admission. His home hydralazine and metoprolol were continued, and his metporolol dose was increased to provide better control of his blood pressures at home. #DM - Stable, patient's home lantus regimen was continued with additional insulin sl.

Patient appeared clinically well with normal vital signs; lactate uptrended and did not improve with IVF. Suspected type B lactic acidosis secondary to malignancy. For acidosis she was given NaHCO3 supplementation both PO and IV which improved her bicarb to 15 upon discharge. Her lactate also trended down as her renal function improved. She was discharged on PO sodium bicarb replacement with close oncologic follow up. # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 3.6 on admission and continued uptrending to a max of 5.8. Thought most likely secondary to ATN from poor PO intake recently. Renal were consulted and also had concern for HRS like physiology given liver metastases and evidence of poor hepatic function. However, ___ improved without intervention and patient's urine output was >1L daily with evidence of post-ATN diuresis. Her Cr was trending down upon discharge and she had no immediate need for HD as her potassium and phosphorus were normal. She was discharged with close follow up. # Hypernatremia: To peak 152, thought likely due to poor PO intake and sodium bicarb repletion. PO was encouraged and free water repleted. Sodium normal (144) upon discharge. # Nausea and Vomiting: Suspected due to recent chemotherapy, possible contribution of liver metastases and hepatomegaly. Given ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and lorazepam prn with good effect. # Hyperuricemia: Concerning for tumor lysis syndrome. Hem/onc were consulted and had low concern. She did receive rasburicase in ED x1, with resolution. # Transaminitis: Albumin and INR relatively normal. Thought likely secondary to massive hepatic infiltration with tumor. Trending down upon discharge. # History of DVT: At home anticoagulated with enoxaprin. Upon admission was transitioned to heparin drip given ___. Heparin drip stopped secondary to melena upon arrival to the floor. The melena resolved and she was restarted on renaly dosed lovenox 40mg daily for GFR <30.

Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA. This resolved over the next few days. . #CODE: Full #CONTACT:. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_length`.\n",

            "Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMH of Alport syndrome c/b ESRD on ___ HD, bipolar disorder, and PTSD who presented with ___nd facial swelling, cough, and orthopnea and was found to have SVC syndrome. #SVC syndrome: #Deep vein thrombosis: On ___, she developed acute-onset neck and facial swelling and presented to ___ Ed. She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine. Her clonidine was discontinued and pressures remained within normal limits (120s-130s systolic). Her hypoxemia also spontaneously improved and may be related to a possible viral bronchitis. # OLIGURIA/HEMATURIA: Likely post-operative urinary retention after anesthesia. Straight cathed with output of 500cc dark wine colored urine. Bolused with 500cc. Low suspicion for neurogenic bladder given report of low back/CVA pain. Resolved midnight ___ pt denies dysuria, hematuria. Good rectal tone; neurogenic bladder unlikely. Resolved spontaneously. #ESRD ___ alport syndrome: She continued ___ HD while in-house. #Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Noted on ___ as well as our CTA. Likely reactive, however a CT chest as an outpatient should be considered to assess for resolution. #Thyroid nodule: Noted on CT chest, per PCP was previously scheduled for an outpatient thyroid ultrasound by her endocrinologist but did not show up for testing. She should have an U/S as an outpatient. #Anemia: Has chronic anemia ___ renal disease, held stable. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Will need INR checked on ___ with adjustment in warfarin dose to maintain INR of ___. [ ] consider hematology consultation as an outpatient to discuss the duration of her anticoagulation course given that she may have had a prior clot at her HD line site and will likely need a continued HD line. [ ] her clonidine was discontinued given that she had an episode of hypotension and pressures were stable in 120s-130s without clonidine. Consider restarting if clinically indicated. [ ] Consider thyroid ultrasound as an outpatient given thyroid nodule noted on CT. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##. SBP. 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid was drained on ___ and met criteria for SBP. 150gms of albumin was administered ___ and another 150gms of albumin were administered on ___ per protocol. She was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q24 on ___ and completed a ___ipro prophylaxis was considered, although it was felt that prohpylaxis was probably unnecessary because the fluid was likely only positive for SBP due to her underlying malignancy. . ##.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s. Because of this, we started her back on a lower dose of metop at 12.5mg PO q6H, and transitioned her to metop 50mg XL daily at the time of discharge. We also discontinued her diltiazem. At the time of discharge, her sinus bradycardia had resolved and she was asymptomatic. She will follow-up with cardiology on ___. #Hypertension: During this admission, Ms. ___ became hypertensive with blood pressure ranging from 120s-160s/60s-80s. We started her on amlodipine 10mg and her blood pressure continuously improved. At the time of discharge, her blood pressures were from 120s-140s/60s-80s. ___: At the time of admission, Ms. ___ had a ___ of 1.4 that was likely ___ decreased renal forward flow combined with decreased PO intake. We managed her bradycardia as above and encouraged her to increase her intake of POs. Her ___ normalized and Cr was back to 0.9 at the time of discharge. #Primary Prevention: Due to her history of diabetes, hypertension and CAD, we started her on aspirin 81mg daily. We continued her on her home pravastatin. #Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia from macroglobulinemia and cold agglutinins but has a new drop in MCV from 88 to 78.

He presented to ___ where a CT scan showed significant for large left hilar mass with apparent invasion of the pericardium with tumor extending into the left atrium. Staging MRI head significant for three enhancing lesions with slow diffusion and surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality, most likely representative of intracranial metastasis. Further staging with CT torso significant for multiple intraperitoneal, serosal, retroperitoneal, and intramuscular metastatic implants. EBUS was performed on ___ for tissue sample, which revealed small cell lung cancer with high proliferation index (___). He also had an FNA for a new right preauricular mass that showed malignancy as well. A TTE was performed which revealed mild-moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and LVEF >75%. Palliative care was consulted. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide (___), which he tolerated well with minimal GI complaints. He is scheduled for follow up with the Multi-Specialty Thoracic Clinic. He will be scheduled for port placement prior to the next round of chemotherapy. # Acute kidney injury: Patient presented with creatinine of 1.4. This improved to his baseline of 0.9 with fluid resuscitation, consistent with prerenal etiology. After initiating chemotherapy, he again developed ___ that was felt to be secondary to cisplatin. On discharge his creatinine was 1.0. # New oxygen requirement: Patient has a long smoking history and known severe COPD. He developed worsening dyspnea in the setting of impingement of the mass into the left sided bronchovasculature. He was managed with Advair, tiotropium, and Albuterol nebs as needed. He was discharged with home oxygen therapy. # Anemia: No known baseline. Iron studies were sent and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to his underlying malignancy. He did not require a blood transfusion during hospitalization. # Suspected BPH: Patient endorsed difficulty initiating a stream and reports previous history of prostate issues, but no longer on medication.

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is pending at the time of discharge. ___ pathology department has requested the pathology specimens from the patient's past malignancy for comparison. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid per ID recommendation. The patient will complete a course of 2 additional weeks of linezolid after discharge.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not. We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today.

Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved.

Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #.

Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 qdaily for improved BP control. #CAD: Patient's last cath was in ___ which was negative. ___ cath showed moderate single vessel disease and was advised to be medically managed. His home aspirin, statin, and metprolol were continued while he was hospitalized. #HX OF STROKE: Patient has suffered stroke in the past and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. His home plavix and aspirin were continued. #HYPERTENSION: Hypertensive to 180s systolic on admission. Goal BP for this elderly gentleman is 160s systolic, will attempt to control BP in light of flash pulmonary edema on admission. His home hydralazine and metoprolol were continued, and his metporolol dose was increased to provide better control of his blood pressures at home. #DM - Stable, patient's home lantus regimen was continued with additional insulin sl.

            "Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF DISCHARGE SUMMARY ========================= Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with Sjogren's syndrome and Lupus c/b Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ with allograft CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) and history of DVT who presented with fever. She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is pending at the time of discharge. ___ pathology department has requested the pathology specimens from the patient's past malignancy for comparison. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid per ID recommendation. The patient will complete a course of 2 additional weeks of linezolid after discharge. Rib fracture pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch. #Troponemia: Most likely secondary to demand. Appears to be .12 on last check at OSH. He never had any chest pain or concerning ECG changes. This was rechecked on admission to ___ and found to be normal. #Dysphagia ___ prior radiation: Poor nutrition at baseline as he has dysphagia to solids. Currently followed by SLP at ___. Medications were given as liquids whenever possibile. Full liquid diet was ordered with 2 nutrition supplements at each meal. #Dyspnea: Most likley acutely decompensated in setting of pneumonia and effusions. However, he describes progressive decline in respiratory status over the course of years which he also attributes to chemo and radiation side effects. He has a pulm initial evaluation scheduled for this ___. #Constipation: At the time of discharge, he is taking Milk of magnesia daily, Psyllium BID and mag citrate PRN for management of his narcotic induced constipation. # Anxiety: Patient experienced significant anxiety while his chest tube was in place. THis responded well to lorazepam and self-resolved when his pigtail was removed. # Code: full code # Emergency Contact: ___, Brother, ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please follow-up pending pleural fluid cytology from ___. ___ Pathology requested tissue specimens from patient's prior malignancy to rule out recurrence as the cause of pneumonia/effusion.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not. We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today. We treated him with ipratoprium/albuterol nebs and this should be discussed in the outpatient setting in terms of his COPD medications. . # Chronic Back Pain with Neuropathic Symptoms - continued gabapentin . # Restless Leg Syndrome - continued ropinirole at bedtime . # Depression - continued sertraline . # GERD - continued pantoprazole . #.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo male with significant past cardiac history including CABG x2 and PCI x2 with chronic angina relieved by nitro transferred to cardiology service after right renal artery ___ embolization for a subcapsular hematoma resulting from MVA, for chest discomfort in the setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response from 2:1 atrial flutter refractory to metoprolol 15 mg and diltiazem 10 mg IV and ST depressions throughout precordial leads. . # MVA and subcapsular hematoma: After his MVA and subsequent imaging, Mr. ___ went urgently to ___ given extravasation from the lower pole of the kidney, which was embolized. A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA. This resolved over the next few days. . #CODE: Full #CONTACT:. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_length`.\n",

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. . TRANSITION OF CARE: [ ] Rheumatology - Determine whether or not to continue Prednisone at the ___ clinic visit. [ ] Neurology - Followup the patient's symptoms from her cervical spondylosis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Pending results to follow up: none Follow up appointments made: Appointment: Rheumatology Follow-Up Provider: ___, MD ___ ___ 1:00 . Appointment: Neurology Follow-Up Provider: ___ ___ ___ 4:00 .

Exam improved quickly with diuresis, though course was complicated by urosepsis, as below. Ultimately diuresed well on Lasix drip at 15 units per hour. Home beta blocker was discontinued in the setting of bradycardia, and spironolactone stopped given hyperkalemia. On day of discharge, patient was net negative 3L for the admission, and her symptoms had improved significantly. Torsemide was increased to 30mg daily. Discharge weight: 64.5 kg # Sepsis secondary to urinary source: Patient presented with increased urinary frequency and subjective fevers at home. Was found to have leukocytosis to 14, grossly positive urinalysis, and systolic blood pressure in the ___. Hemodynamics improved after IVF. Blood cultures showed no growth. Treated with cefepime/ceftriaxone for total course of ten days. Of note, attempted to switch to oral ciprofloxacin, but patient developed a drug rash (as below), put back on ceftriaxone for the duration of the antibiotic course. # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Known history of chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 1.6-1.8. Elevated to 2.6 on admission. Thought to be cardiorenal in setting of acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation vs. acute tubular necrosis related to hypotension in the setting of urosepsis.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ yo man with history of paranoid schizophrenia and epilepsy who presents with breakthrough seizures felt likely to be due to medication non-compliance. #Breakthrough seizure: On presentation he was febrile with leukocytosis to 21. CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis.

The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 qdaily for improved BP control. #CAD: Patient's last cath was in ___ which was negative. ___ cath showed moderate single vessel disease and was advised to be medically managed. His home aspirin, statin, and metprolol were continued while he was hospitalized. #HX OF STROKE: Patient has suffered stroke in the past and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. His home plavix and aspirin were continued. #HYPERTENSION: Hypertensive to 180s systolic on admission. Goal BP for this elderly gentleman is 160s systolic, will attempt to control BP in light of flash pulmonary edema on admission. His home hydralazine and metoprolol were continued, and his metporolol dose was increased to provide better control of his blood pressures at home. #DM - Stable, patient's home lantus regimen was continued with additional insulin sl.

            "Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF DISCHARGE SUMMARY ========================= Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with Sjogren's syndrome and Lupus c/b Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ with allograft CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) and history of DVT who presented with fever. She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

He was also started on metoprolol. He has plans to follow up with cardiology as an outpatient. . # Chronic systolic CHF - Patient remained euvolemic throughout admission. His torsemide was initially held in the setting of GI bleed. However, it was subsequently restarted prior to discharge. He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission. . # Diabetes - Metformin was held during admission. His blood sugars were controlled with insulin sliding scale. . # Afib on coumadin - INR initially supratherapeutic (3.6) on presentation. He was treated with FFP initially and coumadin was held in the setting of GI bleed. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge. He has plans to have his INR rechecked on ___ at PCP follow up . # HTN - cont medications as above . # HLD - continued pravastatin . # PVD - Plavix and ASA initially held with GI bleed but restarted prior to discharge . Transitional Issues: - Just after discharge patients H. pylori antibody returned as positive. PCP and gastroenterologist were notified. Patient should be treated with Prevpac. - Patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg BID for PUD until GI follow up. - Patients INR was subtherapeutic upon discharge. His INR will need close follow up after discharge and coumadin dosing will likely need additional adjustment. - Patient was started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission given his hx of CAD and CHF. Patient will need his electrolytes checked within 2 weeks of discharge. He will also need his blood pressure and heart rate rechecked. - patient was.

Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery. Patient's left ankle was splinted and casted on second day of hospitalization and she is to follow-up in Orthopedic Surgery Clinic on ___ at 11:00 am. Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications. Her affect was initially depressed and she was frequently tearful when discussing her psychosocial stressors, roommate's delirium etc. Patient is followed closely by psychiatrist ___ as outpatient. . #.

Pt was treated conservatively and physical therapy recommended acute rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and was treated with IV antibiotics for Hospital-acquired pneumonia. . #. Pubic Ramus fracture: Orthopedic surgery was consulted. OSH films revealed an acute R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. This was felt to be most likely due to her recent seizure. Medical management was recommended with outpatient orthopedics follow-up in ___ weeks. She was started on lovenox 40 mg qday for DVT prophylaxis to be continued for 4 weeks. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt the patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation. Tylenol ___ mg TID was started for pain. Calcium and VitD were started for bone health. . # Pneumonia: Patient had low-grade temperatures to 100.3 on ___ and 100.7 on ___. Out of concern for cough, a CXR was obtained, which showed a possible RML infiltrate vs. atelectasis. The following day, she became hypotensive to the ___, which responded to fluid bolus. Repeat CXR was obtained, which showed worsened pneumonia. She was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia initially with Cefepime 2g q24h, Vancomycin 750 mg q24h, and Metronidazole. Metronidazole was discontinued prior to discharge and she remained clinically stable off of this medication. The patient was discharged to complete a 7-day course of Cefepime and Vancomycin, last day ___. . # UTI: On admission, U/A and urine culture were negative. However, OSH records indicated she had been treated with 1-dose of ciprofloxacin for a sensitive enterococcus UTI. Repeat U/A was performed when the patient became hypotensive and culture grew enterococcus. Antibiotics with Vancomycin/Cefepime were continued as above, which provided appropriate coverage for UTI. The patient should not have a foley catheter placed under any circumstances given recurrent UTIs. . # Cough: Speech and swallow was consulted out of concern for the patient coughing during eating. They felt the patient showed no obvious signs of aspiration at bedside exam and recommended pureed foods, thin liquids, and 1:1 assistance with eating. If there is coughing with eating, the patient may benefit from a video swallow study. . #. Seizure d/o: Pts first seizure was ___ years ago and was started on Keppra 500 mg BID which was decreased to once daily with symptoms of somnolence. She was recently weaned off Keppra and developed recurrent seizures for which she was seen at an OSH in ___. Keppra was restarted at her prior dose of 500 mg per day. This low dose was discussed with ___ at ___ and was felt to be reasonable given her age, size, and prior success with this dose. She was kept on seizure precautions. . # CVA: Pt with h/o CVA. Carotid duplex was obtained, which showed 40-59% stenosis bilaterally. ASA 325 mg per day was continued for secondary prophylaxis as the patient had a history of hemoptysis on plavix therapy. . #. Hyponatremia: Chronic per outide records. ___ diagnosed on urinalysis. ___ was placed on a 1.5L fluid restriation and Na improved from 129 to 134. . # Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine 50 mcg qday. . # HTN: Continued Atenolol to 25 mg qday. . #.

Patient appeared clinically well with normal vital signs; lactate uptrended and did not improve with IVF. Suspected type B lactic acidosis secondary to malignancy. For acidosis she was given NaHCO3 supplementation both PO and IV which improved her bicarb to 15 upon discharge. Her lactate also trended down as her renal function improved. She was discharged on PO sodium bicarb replacement with close oncologic follow up. # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 3.6 on admission and continued uptrending to a max of 5.8. Thought most likely secondary to ATN from poor PO intake recently. Renal were consulted and also had concern for HRS like physiology given liver metastases and evidence of poor hepatic function. However, ___ improved without intervention and patient's urine output was >1L daily with evidence of post-ATN diuresis. Her Cr was trending down upon discharge and she had no immediate need for HD as her potassium and phosphorus were normal. She was discharged with close follow up. # Hypernatremia: To peak 152, thought likely due to poor PO intake and sodium bicarb repletion. PO was encouraged and free water repleted. Sodium normal (144) upon discharge. # Nausea and Vomiting: Suspected due to recent chemotherapy, possible contribution of liver metastases and hepatomegaly. Given ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and lorazepam prn with good effect. # Hyperuricemia: Concerning for tumor lysis syndrome. Hem/onc were consulted and had low concern. She did receive rasburicase in ED x1, with resolution. # Transaminitis: Albumin and INR relatively normal. Thought likely secondary to massive hepatic infiltration with tumor. Trending down upon discharge. # History of DVT: At home anticoagulated with enoxaprin. Upon admission was transitioned to heparin drip given ___. Heparin drip stopped secondary to melena upon arrival to the floor. The melena resolved and she was restarted on renaly dosed lovenox 40mg daily for GFR <30. Factor Xa to be checked on ___ at oncology appointment. If therapeutic can remain on this dose as long as her Cr is >1.3 if her weight stays the same (weight on discharge 103.8 lbs). CHRONIC ISSUES # Metastatic Breast Cancer: Doxil healed during admission.

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level.

A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative. The patient was not treated for this one episode offever. . # HTN: Pt continued Toprol and ACE after resolution ___ . # HLD: Pt restarted on statin, zetia, niaspan after CK downtrended and atrial flutter converted. . # ___: Most likely from subcapsular hematoma and injury following MVA.

            "Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ M with HCM, CP syndrome with multiple admission, PAfib s/p PVI s/p PPM implantation s/p AV nodal ablation, HTN, HL, OSA, who p/w chest pain x 1 week here for ___. . # Chest pain / CAD Patient has chronic chest pain, and presenting CP is similar though progressing for past week. Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not. We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today. We treated him with ipratoprium/albuterol nebs and this should be discussed in the outpatient setting in terms of his COPD medications. . # Chronic Back Pain with Neuropathic Symptoms - continued gabapentin . # Restless Leg Syndrome - continued ropinirole at bedtime . # Depression - continued sertraline . # GERD - continued pantoprazole . #.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##. SBP. 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid was drained on ___ and met criteria for SBP. 150gms of albumin was administered ___ and another 150gms of albumin were administered on ___ per protocol. She was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q24 on ___ and completed a ___ipro prophylaxis was considered, although it was felt that prohpylaxis was probably unnecessary because the fluid was likely only positive for SBP due to her underlying malignancy. . ##.

            "Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ year old male with history of HTN, HLD, CAD, dCHF (EF 55-60% in ___, Diabetes on insulin, hx of CVA, recently diagnosed pericardial effusion, p/w acute-onset altered mental status, unsteadiness, urinary incontinence found to also be in respiratory distress. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Likely ___ flash pulmonary edema. Patient being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ with no changes in ejection fraction. #ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx of stroke but CT head was negative for acute intracranial process. Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on differential given fevers in setting of AMS. Patient could have also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no prior hx of seizures. Infectious work up sent off which came back negative. Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting respiratory distress. #Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis. #CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 qdaily for improved BP control. #CAD: Patient's last cath was in ___ which was negative. ___ cath showed moderate single vessel disease and was advised to be medically managed. His home aspirin, statin, and metprolol were continued while he was hospitalized. #HX OF STROKE: Patient has suffered stroke in the past and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. His home plavix and aspirin were continued. #HYPERTENSION: Hypertensive to 180s systolic on admission. Goal BP for this elderly gentleman is 160s systolic, will attempt to control BP in light of flash pulmonary edema on admission. His home hydralazine and metoprolol were continued, and his metporolol dose was increased to provide better control of his blood pressures at home. #DM - Stable, patient's home lantus regimen was continued with additional insulin sl.

Also noted to have hypernatremia, likely secondary to dehydration/decreased PO intake. . #Altered Mental Status: The patient initially presented to the ED after he was found to be more lethargic by his family. His mental status changes were felt to be secondary to infectious etiology, given fever, leukocytosis, and imaging findings of possible pneumonia and colitis on presentation. His mental status improved with antibiotics and IVFs, and he was back to his baseline mental status prior to discharge. Of note, he is generally non-verbal at baseline, with occasional mumbled speech. Per his family, he will respond to hearing his name, but does not follow commands. . #Colitis: Patient presented with diffuse abdominal tenderness on exam, and CT abdomen/pelvis findings were suggestive of colitis (infectious vs. inflammatory vs. ischemic) in the descending colon. Stool was guiac positive. Lactate was within normal limits. Given fever and leukocytosis in addition to exam and imaging findings, the patient was started on antibiotic therapy. He had received vanco/zosyn and metronidazole initially in ED, and was switched to metronidazole/levofloxacin on transfer to floor given concern for colitis and CAP. Following initiation of antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile, WBC trended down, and abdominal tenderness resolved. The patient will be discharged on 4 additional days of PO metronizadole to complete a 10 day course. . #Pneumonia: Chest imaging on presentation could not exclude consolidation, and patient was noted to have new oxygen requirement, fever, and leukocytosis on day of admission. Was some concern for aspiration PNA given dementia, though speech and swallow evaluation felt patient did not appear to be aspirating. Patient started on levofloxacin given concern for community-acquired PNA, and completed a five day course of treatment. He was afebrile for the remainder of his hospital course, WBC trended down, and he was satting well on room air at time of discharge. . #Hypernatremia: Na level noted to be elevated at 157 on admission, and hypernatremia was most likely secondary to dehydration in setting of decreased PO intake and dementia. Na level trended down with IVF administration, and was within normal limits at 144 prior to discharge. The patient's family was advised to encourage increased fluid intake at home following discharge. The patient will have repeat labs 3 days post-discharge to monitor Na levels, and he also has PCP ___ 5 days post-discharge. . #DM Type 2: The patient was continued on home dose of insulin glargine 40 units QAM, with insulin s/s. He had several episodes of hyperglycemia with FSBS in the 300s-400s, in setting of infection and administration of IVF with ___ NS to correct hypernatremia. His insulin s/s was adjusted accordingly. The patient should ___ with his PCP regarding possible adjustment of his insulin dosing at home. . #Hypertension: Per family's report, the patient was not on any anti-hypertensives prior to admission. During his hospital course, he was noted to have elevated BPs, with SBP ranging 130s-170s. He was briefly started on amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily, however this was not continued on discharge given desire to simply medication regimen in setting of advanced dementia.

Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis. She has SpO2 in the low ___ even after diuresis. She was noted to desaturate when sleeping. OSA is strongly suspected, possibly with a component of central apnea. The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

Pt was treated conservatively and physical therapy recommended acute rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and was treated with IV antibiotics for Hospital-acquired pneumonia. . #. Pubic Ramus fracture: Orthopedic surgery was consulted. OSH films revealed an acute R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. This was felt to be most likely due to her recent seizure. Medical management was recommended with outpatient orthopedics follow-up in ___ weeks. She was started on lovenox 40 mg qday for DVT prophylaxis to be continued for 4 weeks. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt the patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation. Tylenol ___ mg TID was started for pain.

Patient appeared clinically well with normal vital signs; lactate uptrended and did not improve with IVF. Suspected type B lactic acidosis secondary to malignancy. For acidosis she was given NaHCO3 supplementation both PO and IV which improved her bicarb to 15 upon discharge. Her lactate also trended down as her renal function improved. She was discharged on PO sodium bicarb replacement with close oncologic follow up. # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 3.6 on admission and continued uptrending to a max of 5.8. Thought most likely secondary to ATN from poor PO intake recently. Renal were consulted and also had concern for HRS like physiology given liver metastases and evidence of poor hepatic function. However, ___ improved without intervention and patient's urine output was >1L daily with evidence of post-ATN diuresis. Her Cr was trending down upon discharge and she had no immediate need for HD as her potassium and phosphorus were normal.

In the ED he had stable vital signs but was found to have a Hgb/HCT of ___ (down from ___ in ___, however was previously anemic with HCTs between ___, and an elevated INR of 3.6. Patient was given 2 units of FFP and subsequently developed hives. He was then given benadryl and hives resolved. He was evaluated by GI with plans to do EGD/colonoscopy the following morning. His ASA, plavix, and coumadin were held. Patient was monitored overnight in the MICU. He was given IVF but no additional blood products. HCT remained stable around ___. He subsequently underwent an EGD/colonoscopy and was transferred to the medicine floor. Endoscopy was significant for duodenal ulcers, diverticulosis, and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He was transfused with 2 units of PRBC given demand ischemia (see below) and responded appropriately. ASA, plavix, and warfarin were restarted. H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable through remainder of admission. He was discharged with plans to follow up with his PCP and with gastroenterology. After discharge h.pylori serology were +, patient will need to be treated by PCP as an outpatient. . # Chest pain: On evening after endoscopy, patient had an episode of substernal chest pain with associated ECG changes. Troponins were elevated but CKMB was WNL. His chest pain resolved with sublingual nitro x2. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and it was felt this chest pain was most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and anemia. He was subsequently transfused 2 units of PRBC. He remained chest pain free through the remainder of the admission and his troponins started to trend down by time of discharge. He was continued on his ASA, statin and plavix. He was also started on metoprolol. He has plans to follow up with cardiology as an outpatient. . # Chronic systolic CHF - Patient remained euvolemic throughout admission. His torsemide was initially held in the setting of GI bleed. However, it was subsequently restarted prior to discharge. He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission. . # Diabetes - Metformin was held during admission. His blood sugars were controlled with insulin sliding scale. . # Afib on coumadin - INR initially supratherapeutic (3.6) on presentation. He was treated with FFP initially and coumadin was held in the setting of GI bleed. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge. He has plans to have his INR rechecked on ___ at PCP follow up . # HTN - cont medications as above . # HLD - continued pravastatin . # PVD - Plavix and ASA initially held with GI bleed but restarted prior to discharge . Transitional Issues: - Just after discharge patients H. pylori antibody returned as positive. PCP and gastroenterologist were notified. Patient should be treated with Prevpac. - Patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg BID for PUD until GI follow up. - Patients INR was subtherapeutic upon discharge. His INR will need close follow up after discharge and coumadin dosing will likely need additional adjustment. - Patient was started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission given his hx of CAD and CHF.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ yo man with history of paranoid schizophrenia and epilepsy who presents with breakthrough seizures felt likely to be due to medication non-compliance. #Breakthrough seizure: On presentation he was febrile with leukocytosis to 21. CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful.

            "Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF DISCHARGE SUMMARY ========================= Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with Sjogren's syndrome and Lupus c/b Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ with allograft CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) and history of DVT who presented with fever. She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Hypoxia. Acute in onset with concern for PE given underlying malignancy. Differential includes splinting from abdominal pain, increased abdominal pressure from ascites, and rapidly accumulating pleural effusion. CTA torso performed ___ with read negative for PE, but significant for moderate left sided pleural effusion markedly worse from CT ___. IP performed thoracentesis on ___, but the fluid was loculated and only 450cc could be removed. As a result, the patient was discharged with home O2 as her hypoxia did not fully resolve s/p thoracentesis. . ##. Refractory emesis, constipation. There was concern for ileus vs. obstruction. She was made NPO, all meds transitioned to IV, narcotic pain meds were avoided on ___, but no NGT was placed. CTA torso ___ revealed moderate degree of ascites, increased since ___, in loculated collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Given the multiple loculations, ___ felt that there was not a large enough fluid pocket to justify paracentesis. Enema administration induced a bowel movement. Her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clear to regular. Reglan IV was also administered to stimulate gut motility. . ##. Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma: The patient presented with vague abdominal compaints, decreased appetite, and difficulty urinating. Unfortunately, a CT scan showed likely recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma. There was a new small left-sided pleural effusion, with new moderate ascites, and new omental and peritoneal nodularity in keeping with peritoneal spread of ovarian carcinoma. There was a contained fluid collection seen within the pelvis extending to the left, which is compressing the sigmoid colon and is slightly walled off likely due to the peritoneal disease that is present. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Her CA-125 was also elevated at 455. ___ was able to drain 2.4 Liters of abdominal fluid on ___ and she will likely need more paracenteses in the future. Fluid cytology was consistent with recurrent carcinoma. She was started on pain control with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain as well as standing oxycontin BID for long acting pain control. The patient was also enrolled in the PARP trial to receive an experimental chemo regimen. . ## Constipation: The patient had profound constipation which was likely secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid accumulation in her abdomen causing ileus. Obstrcution was ruled out. She had a BM with an enema. She was maintained on colace, senna, Miralax, bisacodyl PO/PR, reglan, and simethicone PRN. . ##.

Appears to be chronic small vessel disease. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.05 but CK and MB flat. Patient also has acute renal failure at this time, likely accounting for mild trop elevation. He was monitored on tele, had cardiac enzymes x 3 which were significant for troponin of 0.05--> 0.07 --> 0.07 in the setting of an elevated Cr. We continued plavix and aspirin. He went for stress which was largely unchanged from ___ (akinesis of apex with LVEF of 31%). As this LVEF was markedly lower than the previous EF we had from ECHO (which was 60%), he was sent for cardiac catheterization which was negative for any focal occlusions. A repeat ECHO done on the date of discharge showed a LVEF of >55%. His chest pain was not able to be controlled on tylenol, and he eventually became chest pain free with tramadol. He was discharged with a short course of tramadol to be f/u as an outpt. . # Left arm numbness/shooting pain Patient notes that he has shooting pains lasting only seconds, associated with numbness down his left arm intermittently with after moving around in various positions, unclear which positions. He does have chronic back pain associated with shooting pains down left leg for many years, so he may also have spinal stenosis or arthritis of the cervical spine causing similar symptoms in his arm. Appears neuropathic in nature. Alternatively, he may have compression of nerve root further out. No weakness of muscle, no need for urgent intervention. We felt outpatient evaluation would be best for him. Pt was reassured his pacemaker was not shocking him. . # Acute Renal Failure Patient had acute renal failure during previous admission up to 3.1. He presents today with creatinine 1.5, up from 1.2. He appears dry on exam, likely pre-renal etiology. Recently 1.6 on ___. We trended his Cr over his admission and hydrated him with 2L of NS during his admission. His Cr returned to 1.1. . # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker placement. Patient is A-V paced. Patient believes he was switched from warfarin to clopidogrel for Afib because he failed warfarin therapy and had presented to hospital with very elevated INRs, difficult to control. Per previous OMR note, patient may have overdosed on warfarin intentionally, though he states now that he did not. We continued his home amiodarone, metoprolol, and verapamil. . # Hypertension Patient previously on lisinopril, held starting with last hospitalization because of acute renal failure. In addition to continuing his metop and verapamil, we started a 5 mg dose of lisinopril as his Cr returned to baseline. . # ?COPD Patient doesn't recall having a diagnosis of COPD but it is likely because of his strong tobacco history. He notes that he was previously on inhalers, unsure which ones, but he never got a new prescription and stopped taking them years ago. Harsh end-expiratory wheezing today. We treated him with ipratoprium/albuterol nebs and this should be discussed in the outpatient setting in terms of his COPD medications. . # Chronic Back Pain with Neuropathic Symptoms - continued gabapentin . # Restless Leg Syndrome - continued ropinirole at bedtime . # Depression - continued sertraline . # GERD - continued pantoprazole . #.

She was found to have sinus bradycardia without evidence of heart block. An evaluation for an ischemic etiology was negative. Her left arm pain subsequently resolved on its own. We obtained a TTE that demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There was mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. She was on metoprolol 200 mg daily (this was recently increased in the outpatient setting) and diltiazem 180 mg daily at home. The etiology of her sinus bradycardia was thought to be secondary to high home metop and diltiazem doses. While she was here, these agents were held in the setting of her sinus bradycardia and she had remained in sinus rhythm with HR in the ___. On day 2 of admission, she became episodically tachycardic with HR up to the 130s. Because of this, we started her back on a lower dose of metop at 12.5mg PO q6H, and transitioned her to metop 50mg XL daily at the time of discharge. We also discontinued her diltiazem. At the time of discharge, her sinus bradycardia had resolved and she was asymptomatic. She will follow-up with cardiology on ___. #Hypertension: During this admission, Ms. ___ became hypertensive with blood pressure ranging from 120s-160s/60s-80s. We started her on amlodipine 10mg and her blood pressure continuously improved. At the time of discharge, her blood pressures were from 120s-140s/60s-80s. ___: At the time of admission, Ms. ___ had a ___ of 1.4 that was likely ___ decreased renal forward flow combined with decreased PO intake. We managed her bradycardia as above and encouraged her to increase her intake of POs. Her ___ normalized and Cr was back to 0.9 at the time of discharge. #Primary Prevention: Due to her history of diabetes, hypertension and CAD, we started her on aspirin 81mg daily. We continued her on her home pravastatin. #Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia from macroglobulinemia and cold agglutinins but has a new drop in MCV from 88 to 78.

She underwent a CT chest on ___ which showed evidence of a narrowed SVC and partially occlusive thrombus near the distal aspect of her temporary dialysis catheter. She was started on a heparin drip, however after she failed to improve she was transferred to ___ where she underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the clot. She was placed on warfarin and was discharged when her INR reached 2.0. Her goal INR is ___ and may benefit from life-long anticoagulation given her need for an HD catheter. #Cellulitis: CT chest at ___ showed evidence of cellulitis and question of mediastinitis. ID was consulted at ___ and recommended a 5-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. On arrival to our facility, we consulted infectious diseases who felt that this course was sufficient. She completed 6 days of antibiotics. #Cough: She was noted to have a productive cough but no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. On CTA she was noted to have multiple patchy areas of GGOs in the lower lobes c/f infection. Given that she was afebrile and had completed 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, we deferred antibiotics and she did not have any clinical change. #Hypotension: During her course, she experienced an episode of hypotension to the ___ systolic with hypoxemia. Given c/f thrombus spread and resultant PE, she underwent a CTA chest without evidence of PE. She was given IVF and her pressures improved; her hypotension may have been related to volume shifts I/s/o HD as well as medication effect from her clonidine. Her clonidine was discontinued and pressures remained within normal limits (120s-130s systolic). Her hypoxemia also spontaneously improved and may be related to a possible viral bronchitis. # OLIGURIA/HEMATURIA: Likely post-operative urinary retention after anesthesia.

A total of six coils were placed. Another area of vessel abnormality was noticed but could not be embolized. In afternoon, the patient's hematocrit drifted from 29 from 32 despite PRBC transfusion. Repeat CTA torso showed acute bleeding within the perinephric hematoma. ___ did not feel that embolization would fix the bleeding. The patient was stable overnight but during that time had two episodes of chest pain, with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension. Oxycodone was used for pain control. . #Angina: At baseline, pt notes that he has anginal symptoms about ___ times per week relieved with nitroglycerin spray. This may occur at rest or with movement. The pt had two episodes of chest pain with worsened ST depressions in precordial leads in the setting of tachycardia, hypertension while on the surgical service. The pain resolved with nitro and lopressor. He subsequently was transferred to the cardiology floor without incidence of chest pain. Pt had persistently negative troponins and CK-MB. . #Atrial Flutter: Pt developed 2:1 atrial flutter with RVR. This was most likely ___ to adrenergic output from car crash from trauma and bleed. Pt had no hx of flutter or tachyarrythmia before. The patient's rate was refractory to diltiazem and metoprolol. Given the clear precipitant for the patient's atrial flutter and the persistance of this rhythm, he underwent TEE which demonstrated no clots or thrombus, and then cardioversion to NSR. The pt was maintained on high dose aspirin and Toprol 100 BID for CAD secondary prevention. We elected not to restart coumadin since the patient only had a CHADS score of 1 for HTN and the benefits would likely outweigh the risks of rebleed. Also, because the patient had a clear precipitant which resolved, it is unlikely that he will go back into atrial flutter--one of the main reasons why patients are normally kept on anticoagulation for 4 weeks. The high dose aspirin will also provide some protection from stroke. . # CAD and Precordial ST depression: Pt has severe CAD history; however, the pt's precordial ST depressions were rate-related and resolved with return to NSR. Given the patient's CAD history and active chest pain, his HCT was kept near 30 with transfusion. There was no evidence of myocardial injury as enzymes remained persistently flat. Pt continued treatment with statin and toprol. Rampipril was restarted after resolution of ___. . # Elevated temperature: Pt had a fever x1 on ___. Infectious workup was negative but pt did have a cough. The fever did not recur, CXRay demonstrated no pna, WBC count was WNL, blood culture and urine culture were negative.

            "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior left chest melanoma who presented with left hand pain, bilateral buttock pain, deltoid atrophy, left upper extremity weakness, diminished sensation, and elevated inflammatory markers with anemia suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica with mixed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. . Hospital course by problem: ACTIVE ISSUES: #Myalgias - Polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected given the pattern of her pain and her lab findings (ESR 90, CRP 68.9, TSH 7, T4 6.5, T3 105). The patient was initially started on prednisone 60mg daily because of the concern for possible coexisting giant cell arteritis, though there was low clinical suspicion for this diagnosis. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended lowering the dose to predisone 15mg daily. The patient's pain and stiffness improved over the course of her hospitalization and she was discharged home with a plan to follow up with Rheumatology in three weeks to evaluate her progress and adjust her prednisone course as needed. . #Bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits - Given her findings of degenerative disease on C-spine MRI and her suggestive findings on physical exam, the differential diagnosis included both cervical myelopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. She was placed in a soft cervical collar. She was sent for an EMG, the results of which suggest chronic left median neuropathy consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left cervical radiculopathy at the C8 level. She was seen by physical therapy and prescribed bilateral wrist splints to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation. . #Bone Tenderness - Given her bone tenderness and evidence of radiculopathy on exam, there was some concern for recurrent melanoma. A bone scan was performed which showed no evidence of osseous metastases. No PET-CT was performed during this hospitalization. . #Anemia - B12 and folate were normal; iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, perhaps with a concurrent iron deficiency anemia. She was started on ferrous gluconate. . INACTIVE ISSUES: Her hypertension was treated with her home medications (Atenolol 50mg daily, Furosemide 120mg q12h, Lisinopril 5mg daily, Nifedipine 30mg q12h). In terms of her hyperlipidemia, she was previously on Atorvastatin but this had been stopped due to concerns for myopathy/muscle cramps and was not restarted during this admission. Her diabetes mellitus was treated initially with an insulin sliding scale with poor intial glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids; she was then changed to her home insulin regimen and her glucose control improved. She was maintained on her home amitryptyline for migraine prevention. She was also continued on her home gabapentin during this admission. .

Sputum initially grew strep pneumo and MSSA. Sepsis resolved and he was clinically improving and afebrile for several days so coverage was narrowed to Naficillin; however, additional cultures were forwarded from OSH, which showed MRSA. Nafcillin was switched to vancomycin. ID consult agreed with this choice and recommended 3 weeks of vancomycin monotherapy. He did have evidence of right pleural effusion so chest tube was placed by IP. Pleural fluid studies showed sterile exudate, consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is pending at the time of discharge. ___ pathology department has requested the pathology specimens from the patient's past malignancy for comparison. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid per ID recommendation. The patient will complete a course of 2 additional weeks of linezolid after discharge. Rib fracture pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch. #Troponemia: Most likely secondary to demand. Appears to be .12 on last check at OSH.

            "Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ man with 60-pack-year smoking history who recently presented with dry cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, who was found to have a large central lung mass encasing major arteries and invading into the left atrium. # Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer: Patient had slow decline over last month with increasing shortness of breath and new hemoptysis. He presented to ___ where a CT scan showed significant for large left hilar mass with apparent invasion of the pericardium with tumor extending into the left atrium. Staging MRI head significant for three enhancing lesions with slow diffusion and surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality, most likely representative of intracranial metastasis. Further staging with CT torso significant for multiple intraperitoneal, serosal, retroperitoneal, and intramuscular metastatic implants. EBUS was performed on ___ for tissue sample, which revealed small cell lung cancer with high proliferation index (___). He also had an FNA for a new right preauricular mass that showed malignancy as well. A TTE was performed which revealed mild-moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and LVEF >75%. Palliative care was consulted. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide (___), which he tolerated well with minimal GI complaints. He is scheduled for follow up with the Multi-Specialty Thoracic Clinic. He will be scheduled for port placement prior to the next round of chemotherapy. # Acute kidney injury: Patient presented with creatinine of 1.4. This improved to his baseline of 0.9 with fluid resuscitation, consistent with prerenal etiology. After initiating chemotherapy, he again developed ___ that was felt to be secondary to cisplatin. On discharge his creatinine was 1.0. # New oxygen requirement: Patient has a long smoking history and known severe COPD. He developed worsening dyspnea in the setting of impingement of the mass into the left sided bronchovasculature. He was managed with Advair, tiotropium, and Albuterol nebs as needed. He was discharged with home oxygen therapy. # Anemia: No known baseline. Iron studies were sent and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to his underlying malignancy. He did not require a blood transfusion during hospitalization. # Suspected BPH: Patient endorsed difficulty initiating a stream and reports previous history of prostate issues, but no longer on medication. He was started on tamsulosin 0.4mg PO QHS with improvement.

In the ED he had stable vital signs but was found to have a Hgb/HCT of ___ (down from ___ in ___, however was previously anemic with HCTs between ___, and an elevated INR of 3.6. Patient was given 2 units of FFP and subsequently developed hives. He was then given benadryl and hives resolved. He was evaluated by GI with plans to do EGD/colonoscopy the following morning. His ASA, plavix, and coumadin were held. Patient was monitored overnight in the MICU. He was given IVF but no additional blood products. HCT remained stable around ___. He subsequently underwent an EGD/colonoscopy and was transferred to the medicine floor. Endoscopy was significant for duodenal ulcers, diverticulosis, and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He was transfused with 2 units of PRBC given demand ischemia (see below) and responded appropriately. ASA, plavix, and warfarin were restarted. H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable through remainder of admission. He was discharged with plans to follow up with his PCP and with gastroenterology. After discharge h.pylori serology were +, patient will need to be treated by PCP as an outpatient. . # Chest pain: On evening after endoscopy, patient had an episode of substernal chest pain with associated ECG changes. Troponins were elevated but CKMB was WNL. His chest pain resolved with sublingual nitro x2. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and it was felt this chest pain was most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and anemia. He was subsequently transfused 2 units of PRBC. He remained chest pain free through the remainder of the admission and his troponins started to trend down by time of discharge. He was continued on his ASA, statin and plavix. He was also started on metoprolol. He has plans to follow up with cardiology as an outpatient. . # Chronic systolic CHF - Patient remained euvolemic throughout admission. His torsemide was initially held in the setting of GI bleed. However, it was subsequently restarted prior to discharge. He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission. . # Diabetes - Metformin was held during admission. His blood sugars were controlled with insulin sliding scale. . # Afib on coumadin - INR initially supratherapeutic (3.6) on presentation. He was treated with FFP initially and coumadin was held in the setting of GI bleed. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge. He has plans to have his INR rechecked on ___ at PCP follow up . # HTN - cont medications as above . # HLD - continued pravastatin . # PVD - Plavix and ASA initially held with GI bleed but restarted prior to discharge . Transitional Issues: - Just after discharge patients H. pylori antibody returned as positive. PCP and gastroenterologist were notified. Patient should be treated with Prevpac. - Patient was started on omeprazole 40 mg BID for PUD until GI follow up. - Patients INR was subtherapeutic upon discharge. His INR will need close follow up after discharge and coumadin dosing will likely need additional adjustment. - Patient was started on metoprolol and lisinopril during admission given his hx of CAD and CHF.

Now stable/improving on intravenous CTX. # STREP PNEUMONIAE ENDOCARDITIS OF AORTIC VALVE # SEPSIS (RESOLVING) # METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (RESOLVED) She was admitted with sepsis and metabolic encephalopathy and was and found to have Strep pneumo bacteremia in ___ blood cultures. ___ showed endocarditis with a large aortic valve vegetation and a tricuspid valve vegetation. Source of entry may be sinusitis vs a root canal one week prior to presentation. No evidence of pneumonia on CT. She is HIV negative. K/L ratio normal suggesting low likelihood of myeloma. Seen by cardiology and surgery with recommendations for medical treatment and close outpatient followup with ongoing consideration of surgery. Improved on antibiotics, with plan for prolonged course. ___ placed ___. - CTX 2g daily (___-) via home infusion with ___ for at least six weeks - Follow up with ID, PCP, ___, (and possibly cardiac surgery) as outpatient # SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY # ACUTE DIASTOLIC CHF , now CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF After IVF given for sepsis, CXR appeared wet and she was more hypoxic. Echocardiography shows preserved LVEF and severe AI; suspect acute left heart failure was related to her valvular disease. Diuresed with three doses of IV Lasix and subsequently transitioned to PO Lasix (40 daily/40 BID). Based on echo findings her elevated right-sided filling pressures improved. - Started on Lasix 40 mg BID with Losartan 25mg in place of her home HCTZ/triamterene - She will need electrolytes, BP check, weight trend, and CP exam with PCP at her upcoming visit to determine if her diuretic dose is adequate/ensure med safety # RIGHT HEART STRAIN WITHOUT RV SYSTOLIC FAILURE: # CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPERCARBIA # ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA # PRESUMED OBSTRUCTIVE AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL APNEA The patient had elevated pCO2 despite apparent hyperventilation in the setting of sepsis.

The poor resting SpO2 and her right heart strain are suggestive of underlying pHTN. EKG and echo both suggested significant right heart strain, likely worse since admission based on EKG progression. Likely this is due to increased left-sided diastolic pressures in the setting of her AI, and likely a background of chronic pHTN due to her presumed sleep apnea. - She will need sleep study as outpatient; PFT w/ DLCO can also be considered # CHRONIC SINUSITIS # CHRONIC COUGH: CT showed fairly severe chronic sinusitis. Clinically no overt evidence of acute sinusitis. The patient has had a dry cough for a couple months; given her sinus disease, suspect this may be post-nasal drip. She was started on Flonase and instructed on nasal saline irrigation. ******************** OUTSTANDING ISSUES ******************** - Needs a prompt sleep study for suspected OSA (ordered in ___ system, but could also do this at ___) - PCP should please refer her to ___ cardiology and monitor electrolytes/adjust medications for diuretic adequacy - Trend weight and volume exam; adjust Lasix.

            "Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF DISCHARGE SUMMARY ========================= Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with Sjogren's syndrome and Lupus c/b Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ with allograft CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) and history of DVT who presented with fever. She was found to have an acute adenovirus infection with elevated blood PCR levels and was treated with cidofovir. She did not require more than one dose due to significant clinical improvement. Course c/b ___ on CKD likely secondary to the viral infection (positive urine adenovirus PCR) that did not respond to fluids but did improve with time. Course also c/b acute right calf pain; ___ was inconclusive but MRI did show DVT in right external iliac vein. She was initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to warfarin on discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Consider further antiphospholipid syndrome workup, which can be owned by PCP or consider referral to hematology. This hospitalization she had negative cardiolipin antibodies, negative beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, and negative lupus anticoagulant antibodies. [ ] She was referred to the ___ clinic, who will assess her INR level and dose on ___. She will also need additional labs including CMP, LFTs, and tacrolimus level. Discharge Cr: 1.9 Discharge INR: 2.4 MEDICATION CHANGES ==================== - started warfarin for DVT treatment, will need anticoagulation indefinitely - decreased home tacrolimus to 2mg PO BID based on daily levels ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Fever # Cough # Adenovirus infection Spiked high fevers on admission with nonproductive cough, found to have adenovirus infection. Complement levels were normal making Lupus flare less likely, other infectious workup was negative. She was managed with supportive care initially but given high adenovirus blood PCR level and leukopenia she was started on cidofovir with probenacid and fluid premedication. She only had one dose of cidofovir despite positive urine adenovirus PCR because her blood PCR level (drawn prior to the cidofovir dose) was downtrending and she demonstrated significant clinical improvement. # ___ on CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.6) # Lupus nephritis c/b ESRD # s/p DDRT in ___ Presented with Cr 1.8 with no significant improvement with fluids. Likely some element of adenovirus kidney involvement given urine PCR was positive. Treated with cidofovir as discussed above, which was soon discontinued because of clinical improvement. Immunosuppressed with prednisone and tacrolimus, which was dosed daily based on trough levels. # Acute pulmonary edema # Hypoxia # Dyspnea Significant fluid resuscitation for initial ___ led to acute pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxia requiring up to 2L oxygen. CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible bilateral pneumonia. She was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage, which we discontinued after 2 days of treatment because of low suspicion for infection. She responded well to 20mg IV Lasix (maximum diuretic dose) with resolution of her hypoxia. # Deep vein thrombosis # Right calf pain Patient reported acute right calf pain and ___ showed superficial thrombophlebitis and dampened flow in the right common femoral vein. She was started on a heparin gtt and MRI with contrast showed a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right external iliac vein close to her transplanted.

Pt was treated conservatively and physical therapy recommended acute rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and was treated with IV antibiotics for Hospital-acquired pneumonia. . #. Pubic Ramus fracture: Orthopedic surgery was consulted. OSH films revealed an acute R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. This was felt to be most likely due to her recent seizure. Medical management was recommended with outpatient orthopedics follow-up in ___ weeks. She was started on lovenox 40 mg qday for DVT prophylaxis to be continued for 4 weeks. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt the patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation. Tylenol ___ mg TID was started for pain. Calcium and VitD were started for bone health. . # Pneumonia: Patient had low-grade temperatures to 100.3 on ___ and 100.7 on ___. Out of concern for cough, a CXR was obtained, which showed a possible RML infiltrate vs. atelectasis. The following day, she became hypotensive to the ___, which responded to fluid bolus. Repeat CXR was obtained, which showed worsened pneumonia. She was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia initially with Cefepime 2g q24h, Vancomycin 750 mg q24h, and Metronidazole. Metronidazole was discontinued prior to discharge and she remained clinically stable off of this medication. The patient was discharged to complete a 7-day course of Cefepime and Vancomycin, last day ___. . # UTI: On admission, U/A and urine culture were negative. However, OSH records indicated she had been treated with 1-dose of ciprofloxacin for a sensitive enterococcus UTI. Repeat U/A was performed when the patient became hypotensive and culture grew enterococcus. Antibiotics with Vancomycin/Cefepime were continued as above, which provided appropriate coverage for UTI. The patient should not have a foley catheter placed under any circumstances given recurrent UTIs. . # Cough: Speech and swallow was consulted out of concern for the patient coughing during eating. They felt the patient showed no obvious signs of aspiration at bedside exam and recommended pureed foods, thin liquids, and 1:1 assistance with eating. If there is coughing with eating, the patient may benefit from a video swallow study. . #. Seizure d/o: Pts first seizure was ___ years ago and was started on Keppra 500 mg BID which was decreased to once daily with symptoms of somnolence. She was recently weaned off Keppra and developed recurrent seizures for which she was seen at an OSH in ___. Keppra was restarted at her prior dose of 500 mg per day. This low dose was discussed with ___ at ___ and was felt to be reasonable given her age, size, and prior success with this dose. She was kept on seizure precautions. . # CVA: Pt with h/o CVA. Carotid duplex was obtained, which showed 40-59% stenosis bilaterally. ASA 325 mg per day was continued for secondary prophylaxis as the patient had a history of hemoptysis on plavix therapy. . #.

            "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ yo man with history of paranoid schizophrenia and epilepsy who presents with breakthrough seizures felt likely to be due to medication non-compliance. #Breakthrough seizure: On presentation he was febrile with leukocytosis to 21. CSF done in ED showed pleocytosis, WBC 9 but normal glucose and normal protein. He was started on CNS dosing of vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cultures remained NGTD and felt that Pleocytosis was likely reactive iso seizures rather than bacterial CNS infection. He was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR resulted. He monitored on EEG without evidence of electrographic seizures. He was continued on his home AEDs. Once extubated patient said he had not been taking his medication for a long time now but couldn't say how long. - HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir stopped. - Continue Keppra 1250mg BID - We discussed with patient about other agents that would be less cumbersome to take such as long acting medications such as zonisamide, however the patient declined switching his seizure medication and stated he wanted to stay on Keppra #STE on EKG: on admission was noted to have STE on EKG. He was seen by cardiology who felt that likely toxic metabolic rather than ACS. Trop and CKMB were negative x3 and repeat EKG showed improvement in STE. #HTN: Patient's home BP meds were initially held. His nifedipine was restarted on ___. On his medication list it said he was taking Lisinopril but in our records from ___ it was documented that he had angioedema from Lisinopril in the past. Verified with PCP that patient has been taking Lisinopril and does not have an allergic reaction to it. - home nifedipine 60mg ER and lisinopril 40mg daily restarted, blood pressures improved to 130 systolic on home regiment #Pulmonary: intubated d/t agitation at OSH, Required continued sedation due to agitation when weaned. Overnight on ___ he self extubated and was quickly weaned to room air. He did well from respiratory perspective. -no respiratory problems after extubation. ___ on CKD: Creatinine 1.6-> 1.8 from baseline 1.3. Likely due to pre-renal, worsened by acyclovir, and likely pigmented nephropathy from rhabdo. Improved with IVF back to 1.0. Later did well on PO fluids. #Leukocytosis #Fever: WBC elevated to 16 from 20, likely reactive iso seizure. Did spike fever to 101.4 initially but afebrile since. CXR with possible PNA. Blood, csf, and urine culture remain NGTD - Empiric meningitis coverage started but stopped after CSF profile reassuring. - Acyclovir stopped after HSV PCR negative -wbc normalized while patient was on the floor #Psych: history of paranoid schizophrenia unclear adherence to medications. He is taking abilify 15mg daily and was previously on IM abilify. It has been held since he was admitted and unclear if he was taking it as prescribed. - Restarted abilify 15mg daily per psych recs #Shoulder pain: -Patient had L shoulder pain during admission which he states is an old shoulder dislocation that has been imaged by his outpatient providers -given NSAIDs and Tylenol to good effect #Conjunctival hemorrhage L eye: -stable, not painful. Follow up with PCP . Likely traumatic when patient fell during seizure at home prior to admission Transitional Issues =================== [] f/u BP and Cr at PCP ___ [] f/u with psych about medication titration [] follow up with PCP [] follow up with neurologist [] consider switching Kepp. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Also noted to have hypernatremia, likely secondary to dehydration/decreased PO intake. . #Altered Mental Status: The patient initially presented to the ED after he was found to be more lethargic by his family. His mental status changes were felt to be secondary to infectious etiology, given fever, leukocytosis, and imaging findings of possible pneumonia and colitis on presentation. His mental status improved with antibiotics and IVFs, and he was back to his baseline mental status prior to discharge. Of note, he is generally non-verbal at baseline, with occasional mumbled speech. Per his family, he will respond to hearing his name, but does not follow commands. . #Colitis: Patient presented with diffuse abdominal tenderness on exam, and CT abdomen/pelvis findings were suggestive of colitis (infectious vs. inflammatory vs. ischemic) in the descending colon. Stool was guiac positive. Lactate was within normal limits. Given fever and leukocytosis in addition to exam and imaging findings, the patient was started on antibiotic therapy. He had received vanco/zosyn and metronidazole initially in ED, and was switched to metronidazole/levofloxacin on transfer to floor given concern for colitis and CAP. Following initiation of antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile, WBC trended down, and abdominal tenderness resolved. The patient will be discharged on 4 additional days of PO metronizadole to complete a 10 day course. . #Pneumonia: Chest imaging on presentation could not exclude consolidation, and patient was noted to have new oxygen requirement, fever, and leukocytosis on day of admission. Was some concern for aspiration PNA given dementia, though speech and swallow evaluation felt patient did not appear to be aspirating. Patient started on levofloxacin given concern for community-acquired PNA, and completed a five day course of treatment. He was afebrile for the remainder of his hospital course, WBC trended down, and he was satting well on room air at time of discharge. . #Hypernatremia: Na level noted to be elevated at 157 on admission, and hypernatremia was most likely secondary to dehydration in setting of decreased PO intake and dementia. Na level trended down with IVF administration, and was within normal limits at 144 prior to discharge. The patient's family was advised to encourage increased fluid intake at home following discharge. The patient will have repeat labs 3 days post-discharge to monitor Na levels, and he also has PCP ___ 5 days post-discharge. . #DM Type 2: The patient was continued on home dose of insulin glargine 40 units QAM, with insulin s/s. He had several episodes of hyperglycemia with FSBS in the 300s-400s, in setting of infection and administration of IVF with ___ NS to correct hypernatremia. His insulin s/s was adjusted accordingly. The patient should ___ with his PCP regarding possible adjustment of his insulin dosing at home. . #Hypertension: Per family's report, the patient was not on any anti-hypertensives prior to admission. During his hospital course, he was noted to have elevated BPs, with SBP ranging 130s-170s. He was briefly started on amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily, however this was not continued on discharge given desire to simply medication regimen in setting of advanced dementia. The patient will ___ with his PCP regarding his hypertension. . #Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Cr 2.2 on admission, elevated above baseline of around 1.4. ___.

Possibly due to psychosomatization of her recent stressors (relationship with daughter, possibility of losing job, realizing she will not receive a promotion at work etc.) Patient had a normal MRI on ___, making multiple sclerosis lower on the differential. Her neurological exam remained normal throughout her stay. Patient was initially on telemetry, but did not have any documented events nor symptoms. Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel her medications were causing her symptoms, especially as patient had been on all but Vistaril and Lamictal for ___ years. Patient has not been taking Vistaril regularly so it was discontinued. Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had any focal neurologic deficits. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were considered, but calcium, magnesium, B12, folate all came back normal. Of note, patient was found to be subclinically hypothyroid (___ 8.2, with normal free T4). It was unclear whether some of her symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, polyphagia, depression could be attributed to this hypothyroidism - and how much is due to the constellation of symptoms of depression. The decision to start thyroid hormone supplementation will be deferred to patient's primary care physician, ___ will be emailed this information. Patient is aware. . #. Ankle fracture: Orthopedics reviewed patient's films and did not feel she required surgery.

Patient will get repeat imaging and re-evaluation of her physical exam at that time. Physical therapy saw the patient while she was in-house and felt she was initially unable to complete exercises secondary to pain. Chronic Pain Service was consulted who made recommendations to better manage patient's neurological pain (increasing Gabapentin to maximum) and switching patient's initial Percocet 5mg q4hrs with Oxycodone (liquid) 10mg q4hrs to Percocet ___ q4-6 hours. Patient initially required regular doses of both Percocet and Oxycodone every 4 hours but was able to taper her needs to 10mg Percocet every ___ hours by day of discharge. Patient elicited not feeling like her pain was controlled but was able to ambulate, sleep and perform daily tasks without significant limitations. Patient's pain medications were not escalated because of her history of tolerating very high doses of narcotics (20mg Percocet q4 hours?) and narcotics overdose requiring MICU admission for Narcan. Per patient's request, she was discharged with a prescription to set up outpatient physical therapy. She declined the option of having physical therapists come to her home via ___ services. . #. Back pain: Likely traumatic from fall with an acute on chronic back pain component as well. Patient's L-spine and knee xrays were both negative for fractures. Patient was started on Lidoderm patches to her lower back with some relief. . #. Depression/anxiety: Patient was continued on home medications. Her affect was initially depressed and she was frequently tearful when discussing her psychosocial stressors, roommate's delirium etc. Patient is followed closely by psychiatrist ___ as outpatient. . #.
