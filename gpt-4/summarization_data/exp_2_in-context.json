{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old gentleman with past medical history of nephrolithiasis, mild hypercholesterolemia and atrial fibrilation presenting with periumbilical pain in the setting of recent painless hematuria. 1. Nephrolithiasis: Patient with past history of nephrolithiasis for past ___ years and presented with abdominal pain and recent hematuria. A CT Abdomen\/pelvis on ___ showed a 3 x 3 mm obstructive left ureteral stone with upstream hydronephrosis and perinephric fluid and stranding, implying small forniceal rupture. He remained afebrile with negative UA. He was treated with IVF and IV ketorolac and by hospital D2 needed no analgesia. Urology were consulted and felt that the stone would likely pass with conservative management given its size (<5mm). He passed the stone on ___ and this was sent for pathological analysis with results awaited at time of writing. He was noted to have worsening renal function and IVF was increased and although still elevated, creatinine was downtrending on discharge. He had mild signs of fluid overload on discharge due to the aggressive rehydration. 2. ARF: creatinine 1.6 on admission peaking at 2.2 day after admission versus baseline creatinine ~ 1.2. This was felt likely to be a combination of pre-renal azotemia in the setting of poor PO intake in addition to contrast nephropathy given IV contrast for CY-KUB in addition to unilateral hydronephrosis due to his obstructive renal stone. FENa was consistent with pre-renal etiology. Creatinine improved with IVF and hand downtrended to 2.0 by the time of discharge. Patient was instructed to have have Chem 7 checked on ___. He was advised to call his PCP for the result of his labs on ___ and as necessary expedite his o\/p appointment. 3. Left Renal Lesion: Complex left renal hypodense lesion at site of previous excision ___ seen on imaging suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. He had a prior resection of this lesion at ___ and e has an appointment to see his ___ o\/p urologist on ___ for further evaluation of this. 4. Atrial Fibrilation: INR 1.9 on admission. Continued on home regimen of 3 day cycle (2 days of 5mg, 1 day of 5.5mg) but INR was borderline therapeutic and thus was increased to 5.5mg daily on discharge. INR was 1.9 at time of discharge. This should be monitored in the community. 5. Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on home regimen","summary":"You were admitted with abdominal pain and recent blood in your urine. A CT scan showed evidence of a kidney stone in your left kidney that was the likely cause. You were evaluated by urology who felt that your kidney stone would most likely pass with just fluids. You briefly required pain control with ketorolac and after this you continued to be pain free. You passed the stone on ___ and it was sent for analysis. Your kidney function had also declined at the time of admission. This may have been due to dehydration in addition to the mild obstruction your renal stone was causing. This gradually increased and this may have in part been due to the IV dye you received with your CT scan. We gave you IV fluids to hydrate you and your kidney function was starting to improve at the time of discharge but this will need to be rechecked."}

The lack of prodrome or any confusion and nature of the event makes seizure unlikely, and the sudden, brief nature of the muscle contractions makes myoclonus most likely, though the pattern of bitten tongue and incontinence, (with an unclear correlation in time with twitching), were concerning for seizure, and EEG was ordered which was negative for seizure activity. His head CT was read as stable to previous. The most likely cause was baclofen, which had been started ___ for post-CVA pain. His symptoms were consistent wtih some of the typical side effects for Baclofen and after discontinuation of the drug, his symptoms resolved.
