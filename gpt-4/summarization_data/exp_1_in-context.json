{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of CVA with residual R sided weakness and aphasia, CAD s\/p stents ___, ESRD ___ proliferative IgA nephropathy on HD MWF, and T2DM who presents with altered mental status ___ hypoglycemia requiring brief intubation and MICU stay. She was subsequently treated for possible pneumonia, possible line infection and ___ urinary tract infection. With time and the above treatment, her mental status improved. Additionally, several changes were made to her home medication regimen. ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED =============================== #Diabetes Mellitus Type II, with hypoglycemia Patient presented with encephalopathy in the setting of hypoglycemia; FSBG was 30 on arrival. The patient had previously required large doses of insulin, but had subsequently developed ESRD and then been on a prolonged steroid taper for IgA nephropathy, and now has a much lower insulin requirement than she did previously in the setting of a low GFR and no longer being on steroids. Per family report, there seems to have been confusion around the dosing of her insulin as the steroids were decreased, so we believe she had been receiving more insulin than her healthcare providers had intended. The patient was started on dextrose drip briefly and her BG stabilized. Subsequently, her BG ranged between 100-200s with little insulin requirement ___ units daily). Prior to discharge, her home glipizide was restarted and she had multiple hypoglycemic episodes, likely due to ESRD and interactions with fluconazole. Thus, glipizide was discontinued and she was discharged on insulin lispro sliding scale only. The recent decreasing insulin requirement is likely due to development of ESRD. #Metabolic encephalopathy #Sepsis of unclear source #Possible Pneumonia #Possible infected tunneled dialysis catheter When the patient was found hypoglycemic and encephalopathic, she was also hypothermic to 90.6F, and had leukocytosis of 22. Due to concerns regarding mental status, she was intubated in the ED and briefly admitted to the MICU. Initial work-up, including CT head and CXR concerning for left-sided pleural effusion\/consolidation. She was empirically started on vancomycin\/zosyn. After extubation and transfer to the floor, she remained altered. Given persistent leukocytosis, fever x1, and encephalopathy, there was concern for sepsis of unknown origin. Repeat CT head was negative and CT chest showed significant improvement, making her lung findings more consistent with possible mucus plugging than pneumonia. However, she was switched to levofloxacin\/vanc and completed a 5 day course for presumed pneumonia. A blood culture from her indwelling line also was positive for coag negative staph, which could have been a contaminant though given concerns for true infection and intermittent serosanguineous discharge from around the line, she was continued on vancomycin with HD. Urine culture from a foley placed in the MICU also grew significant yeast. The patient was started on fluconazole with planned two week course for ___ UTI. With the above treatments, the fever resolved, leukocytosis downtrended and the AMS improved. She was deemed ready for discharge. Ms. ___ should continue vancomycin (end date ___ and fluconazole (end date ___ to complete a two week course of both. The etiology of her AMS was likely multifactorial due to hypoglycemia, infection and delirium. No exchange of tunneled line during hospitalization. ___ UTI #Candidal Intertrigo Urine culture from the foley placed in the MICU grew ___ yeast. Given difficulties assessing patient for symptoms and persistent encephalopathy, she was started on fluconazole with plan to complete a two week course (end date ___. Also noted to have an erythematous rash under her breast, axilla and inguinal area. She was started on miconazole cream, which was stopped after fluconazole was started. Pelvic exam also done due to concern for vaginal ___. She was noted to have white purulent discharge, swab showed sparse yeast, which would be covered by fluconazole. CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED ========================= #History of Strokes #Hypertension #Hyperlipidemia History of multiple strokes: infarct in the head of the left caudate nucleus (___), lacunar infarcts anteriorly in the right internal capsule (___), and infarct in left pons, possible lacunar infarct in the right cerebellum (___), now with residual right-sided weakness and dysphagia. The etiology of her strokes is likely atherosclerotic disease. In the past, MRA and CTA have consistently shown lots of small and medium vessel disease, but no flow-limiting macrovascular lesions and no abrupt cut-offs consistent with thromboembolic events. While she has never had any sort of home cardiac rhythm monitoring, she has been admitted so many times that the cumulative amount of telemetry and random EKGs makes a pretty good case that she doesn't have a-fib. TTE shows no large ASD, although a bubble study was not done. Thus, the optimal secondary prevention strategy is aggressive modification of her vascular risk factors (HLD\/HTN\/DM and former smoking). Her med list had not been optimized in some time, so extensive changes were made. Her statin was switched to atorvastatin 80mg. Addtionally, her antihypertensive regimen was simplified; her new regimen will be labetalol 300 mg BID, amlodipine 10 mg, and torsemide 100 mg daily. She was on aspirin and Plavix, although she had no clear indication for DAPT and on careful chart review this therapy appears to have been carried forward by provider after provider without the indication ever being discussed. She was continued on aspirin monotherapy. #ESRD #Secondary Hyperparathyroidism #Osteoporosis Patient developed ESRD ___ to recent IgA nephropathy in ___. She remained hemodynamically stable without significant fluid overload and normal electrolytes. The patient has a history of compression fractures. Additionally her PTH is in the ___ in the setting of her CKD. Started vitamin D while here. Also continued on nephrocaps and sevelamer. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =================== [ ] Continue vancomycin with HD (end date ___ [ ] Continue fluconazole 200 mg daily (end date ___ [ ] Needs close follow-up of diabetes management given several recent medication changes.
