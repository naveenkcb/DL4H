Underwent L2-S1 laminectomy with instrumented fusion. Post-operative course complicated as below. # Leg weakness In setting of persisting symptoms of leg weakness postoperative, patient found to have elevated CK peaking at 2810. MRI of her bilateral thighs showed edema of right gluteus maximus and right abductor muscles. Rheumatology was initially consulted given concern for myositis, in the setting of bilateral muscle weakness and elevated CK. Their service felt this was unlikely an autoimmune myositis. ___ have related to operative intervention. CK normalized over subsequent 1 week, and leg weakness was attributed to above spinal pathology. #Acute renal failure Presented with Cr 4.4 from baseline < 1. Clinical picture thought to suggest combination of prerenal, intrinsic, specifically dehydration and NSAID-induced renal injury. Cr improved to 0.5 by time of discharge. # Acute pulmonary embolism The patient's post-op course was complicated by pulmonary embolism, diagnosed 3 days post-operatively in the setting of tachycardia and hypoxia. She was started on heparin drip. Anticoagulation was complicated by postoperative hematoma as below, requiring interruption of anticoagulation for operative intervention as below. Subsequently restarted on warfarin. For later procedures, she received bridging therapy. Prior to discharge remained on a lovenox bridge to warfarin (discharged on warfarin 4mg daily). # Post-operative CSF Leak # Epidural hematoma # Epidural abscess As above, initiation of anticoagulation was complicated by CSF leak, subcutaneous and paraspinal hematoma, with concern for infection of fluid collection, requiring broad spectrum antibiotics and subsequent repeat trip to OR for washout, where the fluid collection was identified as an epidural hematoma on ___. Her cultures continued to show no growth--attributed to the multiple days of antibiotics she received prior to this. Per ID service, she was treated with course of IV ceftazidime and Vancomycin, ___, which she completed during her inpatient stay. Symptoms of urinary retention, fecal incontinence, and poor lower extremity neurologic function, which developed in the setting of this evolving fluid collection, persisted post-operatively and were felt to be consequences of her serious condition--prognosis per the primary surgeon was guarded, with the thought that her recovery would take multiple months. She required scheduled straight catheterization for urination. # Ventral abdominal hernia Patient course complicated by new painful ventral abdominal hernia. She underwent bedside reduction, followed by open hernia repair with mesh placement on ___. She was instructed that she no longer needs to wear the abdominal binder, but if she preferred she could continue to use it. # Acute metabolic encephalopathy # Vertigo # Mild cognitive impairment Course was complicated by episodes of confusion, thought to be secondary to her acute illness as as well as medication effect from opiate pain medication. Confusion sometimes associated with reported vertigo. Neuro exam unremarkable. Symptoms resolved with weaning from opiates. Pain regimen at discharge was tylenol with lidocaine patches. Would avoid opiate pain medications unless for severe pain. Of note, discussion with family during this time was notable that patient had a chronic decline in her mental status prior to this admission, and had been unable to perform her IADLs at home. She returned to her reported baseline, confirmed by family, prior to discharge. As part of a discussion with family, patient was maintained as full-code, but noted that a feeding tube would not be something she would want. # Systolic murmur A systolic murmur was heard on admission, concerning for valvular dysfunction, given fatigue and history of falls. The murmur resolved with IVF. A TTE was completed, notable for left ventricular hypertrophy and suspicion that murmur was due to acceleration through LVOT. # Pancolitis Course complicated by diarrhea in setting of her above infections. Cdiff PCR positive, toxin negative, not felt to represent a clinical infection. CT scan showed pancolitis. Stool culture remained negative. She was treated empirically with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin for a total of 7 days with resolution of her symptoms. Unclear if this was viral vs bacterial enteritis. Her stool was soft, but formed at time of discharge.
