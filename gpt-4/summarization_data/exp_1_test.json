BRIEF SUMMARY: ================= ___ with HTN and HLD presenting with torso pain and sore throat found to have mediastinal mass concerning for malignancy vs sarcoid. Monitored without e\/o airway compromise, and discharged with plan for workup to be completed outpatient with IP. ACUTE\/ACTIVE ISSUES: ==================== #MEDIASTINAL MASS 7 cm posterior mediastinal mass noted on CTA. Given location would be concerning for neurologic or neuroendocrine tumor, sarcoidosis, or (less likely) lymphoma. LDH low, uric acid mildly elevated but not consistent with tumor lysis. Mild compression of right hilum may in part be causing chest pain and back pain symptoms, however was monitored with no evidence of airway compromise, no dyspnea. IP consulted and arranged for outpatient biopsy early next week with patient (will call her to arrange). Tumor markers were sent prior to discharge including: AFP, beta-HCG serum, ACE, LDH. #CHEST and BACK PAINS Pleuritic in nature, likely due to mass detailed above. EKG or troponins not consistent with pericarditis (as symptoms appeared similar to pericarditis presentation). CTA without dissection or pulmonary embolism. Pain largely improved with APAP and toradol. Discharged with Tylenol PRN for pain. #HYPOKALEMIA Likely related to chlorthalidone use. Held chlorthalidone, will have PCP ___ repeat BMP as outpatient. CHRONIC\/STABLE ISSUES: ====================== #HTN: Low to normotensive here, held chlorthalidone. Will follow up with PCP to determine whether she needs to resume as outpatient.","summary":"You had a sore throat, chest pain, and back pain. Blood work and imaging studies were performed to make sure you were not having a heart attack or blood clot in your lungs. These tests were normal. The CT scan of your chest showed a mass around in your chest that is near your airways. We won't know what this mass is until it is biopsied (a sample of the tissue is taken). You were seen by pulmonology (lung doctors) - they will contact you to set up a biopsy procedure next week. Your blood pressures were found to be low here, so we held your blood pressure medication (chlorthalidone)."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ woman with T1-T2 paraplegia, COPD, multiple recent admissions for pneumonia, now admitted with hypoxia and fever, altered mental status. . #. Hypotension: The patient was admitted with relative hypotension compared to home blood pressures. A right IJ CVL was placed in the ED and the patient's pressures did not respond sufficiently to aggressive fluid resuscitation. On admission to the MICU unit, a Levophed drip was started, more NS was administered and her MAP and CVP responded. On ___, the patient was weaned off levophed. She remained relatively normotensive throughout the remainder of her MICU stay, and was eventually transferred to the general medical floors on ___. The pt. had one episode of severe hypotension to 60mmHg SBP accompanied by altered mental status several days after being transferred to the general medical floor. This occurred after delivering 20 mg of Lasix the day prior for severe shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema. Additionally, the pt's O2 sats dropped to the mid 80's and ABG's were performed which showed CO2 retention. The pt. was stabilized with fluid boluses and O2 nonrebreather. At this time, her medication list was re-evaluated as it contained multiple centrally acting sedating medications (medication addendum listed below). The pt. was normotensive for the remainder of her stay. . #. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted with significant hypoxia. Right lower lung exam and CXR findings concerning for pneumonia. Fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, and increased sputum production supportive as well of a pneumonia. Sputum notably pink and mucoid in appearance.

Broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and zosyn, were initiated to treat hospital acquired pneumona. On ___, after persistent hypotension despite treatment, ciprofloxacin was briefly initiated to provide double coverage for pseudomonas. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued on the same day after infectious disease consult advised low probablity of success with cipro after zosyn resistance identified. On ___, Zosyn was discontinued as cultures were vancomycin sensitive. Chest physical therapy was performed throughout her stay and the patient required oxygen supplementation (4 liter nasal canula)at the time of transfer from the MICU. The patient was given 10mg IV lasix on ___ and ___ to diurese the patient after CXR demonstrated evidence of fluid overload.

The following day, the pt's blood pressure dropped and she experienced aother episode of hypoxia (as outlined above). She was bolused fluids, put on NRB, and weaned to 4L NC. At this time, her medication list was also reevaluated (as above) as her MS\/pulmonary performance was waxing and waning since her return from the MICU. After her medication adjustments, the pt's O2 demands slowly improved until discharge where she was doing well breathing room air. . #. Altered mental status: Patient initially presented with altered mental status thought to be likely toxic-metabolic given infection, hypoxia and hypotension. An ABG taken on ___ showed CO2 of 56 suggesting carbon dioxide retention and mental status changes secondary to hypercarbia. However, review of records demonstrated chronic hypercarbia with pCO2s in ___. Altered mental status largely resolved throughout her stay in the MICU. On the general medical floors, the pt. had several issues with waxing\/waning mental status thought to be a combination of poor ventilation\/over sedation with centrally acting medications. Adjustments were made to her medication list, and the pt's mental status improved to a consistently interactive state. Changes in medications are outlined below: . Addendum: Pt has been waxing and waning with her mental status, and has been fluctuating in her ability to maintian oxygen saturations in the 90-92 range, dipping as far as 80%.

A repeat CT showed increased mediastinal\/hilar adenopathy from known Hodgkins disease, with post-obstructive consolidation in left upper and right middle lobes. Interventional pulmonology was consulted for potential bronchial stenting. They reviewed the imaging and her medical history, and felt that the airways involved were too small to stent safely, particularly given her significant CAD\/PCI history and need for Clopidogrel. She was started on broad antibiotics at the OSH for concern of post-obstructive PNA, but this was narrowed then ultimately discontinued as she remained afebrile, without any respiratory distress and stable O2 requirements. She was started on methylpredisolone at OSH for question of COPD flair. She is started on a taper to be continued on discharge. Due to her ongoing hypoxemia, she is being discharged home on supplemental Oxygen. She and her family are counseled extensively on safety of home O2 use, given that the patient continues to smoke.
