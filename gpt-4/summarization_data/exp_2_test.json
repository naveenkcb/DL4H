You had a CT scan and MRI of your head, which showed that you did not have a stroke. Incidentally, a small mass was found near the base of your brain. This does not appear to be dangerous, nor is it likely to be the cause of your symptoms (rather it is most likely cased by your Dercum's disease). Given that your symptoms resolved quickly, it appears you may have had a TIA (transient ischemic attack). This is often caused by small blood clots that originate in the heart, and is more common in people with atrial fibrillation. You have been started on a new medication, called warfarin (Coumadin) to prevent these blood clots from forming. Warfarin takes a few days to start working, so you are being started on clopidogrel (Plavix) in the meantime. Once your warfarin reaches its desired level of function, you should stop taking the clopidogrel. You are also being started on atorvastatin to treat high cholesterol."}
